<p><span class="smcap">To the Boys and Girls</span>:—</p>

<p>In this book we shall wander together a little
farther, by the seaside and by the wayside. Sometimes
we shall walk on the breezy hills; sometimes in the low,
marshy places, where ferns and rushes grow.</p>

<p>Sometimes we shall stroll along the wayside path, where
the wild-flowers and grasses are woven into a wreath.</p>

<p>Sometimes we shall go to the hard, white sand, where
the ocean waves roll to our feet, and bring us shells and
curious treasure from the sea. Again, we shall go down
to the still ponds, where lilies float on the water and
dragon-flies swim in the air.</p>

<p>Wherever we go, let us keep our eyes open and our
minds awake to the lessons of Nature. Then we shall
be able to learn what beauty and wisdom lie hid, even in
such humble things as flies and worms. We shall find
much to delight us in beetles; and be as happy as kings
while we search out the secrets of airy hunters and marvellous
little fishes.</p>

<p class="ph3">A LOOK AT AN ANT.</p>


<p>You have been told<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that an insect is a living
creature with a body made in rings, and divided
into three parts.
Most insects have
six legs, four wings,
and two feelers.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp100" id="i_008" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_008.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">The Wasp.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is a great
Order of insects
which we shall call
the hook-wing family.</p>

<p>The wasp, the bee, the saw-fly, and ant belong to
this family. They are the chief of all the insects.
They can do many strange and curious things.</p>

<p>You will know insects of this great family by
their wings. The front wings are larger than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
back ones. They fold back over them when at rest.</p>

<p>In flight the upper wings hook fast to the lower.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<figure class="figleft illowp100" id="i_009a" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_009a.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">The Bee.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you look carefully at some kinds of insects, you
will soon think I have told you what is not quite
true. Why will you
think that? You will
say to me, “The fly has
two wings, and not
four.” “The ant has no
wings at all.”</p>

<p>Ah, but wait until you study about ants and flies,
and see what you will think then.</p>

<p>The mouth of all the hook-wing insects has two
jaws for cutting or for carrying things. The mouth
is nearly as wide as the head.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp60" id="i_009b" style="max-width: 15.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_009b.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">The Fly.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Above the mouth are two knobs. These knobs
are two big eyes, one on each side of the head.
Between the two big eyes they have some little
ones, on the top of the head.</p>

<p>You see insects are as well supplied
with eyes as crabs are with legs.</p>

<p>The back part of the body of many
insects is made fast to the middle part
by a small joint, or thread. That is because
these insects need to bend, or even double up,
in some of their work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>
<p>The Hook-wing Order is divided into two great
kinds.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp100" id="i_010" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_010.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">The Ant.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The insects of one kind carry a little saw. The
others carry a sword. The sword is a sting. The
saw is to cut up leaves and wood to make nice soft
nests or houses for the eggs. The sword is to fight
with, or to kill things for food. Among the saw-carriers
is the fine, long fly, called a saw-fly. Bees,
ants, wasps, and others carry the sting.</p>

<p>Get one of these insects, and you will see all the
parts of which I have told you. Let us first take
an ant to look at.</p>

<p>The head of an ant seems very large for its body,
and the eyes seem very large for the head. They
look as if they would be heavy for the little ant
to carry.</p>

<p>On the under part of the
body which is next the head
are set the six legs. These
legs and the feet have joints.</p>

<p>On the upper side of this same second part of
the body are set the wings. There are four wings,
two large and two small ones. The upper pair are
larger than the lower ones.</p>

<p>The third or back part of an ant’s body is made
of six rings. On the tip or pointed end of this hind
part is the sting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>Now I hear you cry out, “O, my ant has no
wings!” Well, let me tell you a secret. The
wings of your ant have been cut off, or unhooked,
as you shall hear by and by.</p>

<p>There are many families of ants. Each has its
own name and its own ways. All ants are very wise
in their actions. I shall tell you many strange
things about them. Ants have always been called
“the wise insects.” Would you not like to learn
about their homes, their children, and their way of
life?</p>

<p>Before you study the ants in any book, I wish you
would go out into your garden or into the fields.
Find an ant-hill, and sit or lie by it for an hour or
so. Take some sugar or bits of cake to feed the
ants. Find out for yourselves all that you can
about them. Facts that you learn in this way will
be worth very much to you. Be careful and do not
disturb the hill or alarm the ants.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE LIFE OF AN ANT.</p>


<p>In ant-hills we find drone ants, queen ants, and
worker ants. The drone ants have no sting and do
no work. Their bodies are longer and more slim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
than those of queens.
The drone ants have
wings.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp26" id="i_012" style="max-width: 60.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A House in a Hill.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The queen ants
also have wings.
They have stings,
and their bodies are
round and dark.</p>

<p>The workers are
smaller than queens
and drones. They
are also darker, and
have no wings and
no stings. Workers
are of two sizes, large
and small. They are
the builders, nurses,
soldiers, and servants
of the others.</p>

<p>In an ant-hill there
may be many queens
at one time. Often
the ant-queens work.
They are both mothers
and queens. They
will also act as soldiers.
The queen ant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
is not like the queen bee, who will allow no other
queen to live near her. I think mother ant a better
term than queen ant.</p>

<p>The word “queen” may make you think that
this ant rules the rest. That is not so. Ants have
no leader and no ruler. Each ant seems to act as
it pleases.</p>

<p>The chief work of the queen ant is to lay eggs.
In a short time, out of each egg comes a lively,
hungry, little baby ant. It is called a larva. A
larva is like a small white worm.</p>

<p>This little being needs to be washed, fed, kept
warm and dry, and taken into the air and sun. It
must be cared for, very much as the baby in your
home is cared for.</p>

<p>The workers, who act as nurses, are very kind to
the young larvæ.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> How do they wash these little
things? They lick them all over, as the cat licks
the kitten. They use such care that they keep them
nearly as white as snow.</p>

<p>The nurses feed the baby ants four or five times
each day. The nurses prepare the food in their
crops, to make it soft and fit for the little ants.</p>

<p>The nurses stroke and smooth the larva baby.
It seems as if they patted and petted it. When
the weather is cold, they keep the larvæ in-doors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
When it is warm and dry, they hurry to carry them
up to the top of the hill. They place them there to
bask in the sun. If any rain comes, or the hill is
broken, the nurses run to carry the babies to a safe
place.</p>

<p>When the larva is full grown, it spins around itself
a little fine net, which wraps it all up. When
people see these white bundles in the ant-hills, they
call them “ant-eggs.” They are not eggs. They are
pupa-cases. In them the baby ants are getting ready
to come out, with legs and wings, as full-grown ants.</p>

<p>The pupa-cases are of several sizes. The largest
ones are for queens and drones. The next size
holds large workers; the smallest cases hold the
smallest workers.</p>

<p>There are often in the hills very wee ants called
dwarf ants. When you study more about ants in
other books, you can learn about the dwarfs.</p>

<p>After the ants have been in the little cases some
time, they are ready to come out. The nurse ants
help them to get free.</p>

<p>Many hundreds come out of the cases. They
crowd the old home so full that they can scarcely
find room to move about.</p>

<p>Then they see the light shine in at the little gates
on the top of the hill. They feel the warmth of the
sun. They crawl out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>They push upon each other. The hill is not wide
and high enough for so many uncles and cousins
and sisters and brothers. They act like great
crowds in the streets at a big parade, each one
struggles for his own place.</p>

<p>Young ants, like young people, wish to set up for
themselves in new homes. They spread their fine
wings. Off they fly! Since there is not room in
the old hill they will build a new one.</p>

<p>They swarm as the bees do. As they rise high
from the earth, they drift off on the wind. Very
many of them tire out and die, or are blown into the
water, and are drowned. A few live and settle on
places fit for a new ant-hill.</p>

<p>It is the mother or queen ant who chooses the
new home. When she has found the right place,
what do you think she does? She takes off her
wings, as she does not care to fly any more.</p>

<p>The ant does not tear off her wings. She unhooks
them, and lets them fall away, and does not
seem to miss them.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE ANT’S HOME.</p>


<p>Ants live in nests, made in the earth. We call
them ant-hills, from the shape of the part that is
above ground. It is the queen ant who begins to
build the ant-hill.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp92" id="i_016" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_016.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">The New Home.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Like the mother wasp, the ant works on her nest
until enough ants grow up to do all the work. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
that, like the queen bee, she does no work. The
work ants will not allow her to go from home.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="i_017" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Sappers and Miners.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>When the ant finds a place for her home, how
does she take off her wings? They would be in
her way while she worked. She presses the edge
of a wing upon the ground and so pushes it up and
loosens the hook, just as you unhook a dress. Then
she begins to dig. She acts at first much as your
dog does when he digs after a chipmunk or a rabbit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>
<p>The ant lays her big head close to the ground.
With her fore-feet she digs up the soil, and tosses
it back between her hind legs. She digs as her
cousin, Mrs. Wasp, digs.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp94" id="i_018" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_018.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Sappers and Miners.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>She keeps waving her little feelers, as if to find
out the kind of soil. Soon she has a hole deep
enough to cover her body. It is too deep for her
to throw out the dirt with her feet. Now she uses
her feet, and her jaws, also, to dig with.</p>

<p>Where the soil is sandy, she takes it out, grain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
by grain. At first, she must back out of her hole.
Soon her hall-way is so wide that she can turn
about after she has backed a few steps.</p>

<p>Ants are very kind to each other in their work.
If they push or tread on each other in their haste,
they never fight about it.</p>

<p>The ants know how to work and how to rest.
After a little hard work they stop, clean their
bodies, take some food, and sleep.</p>

<p>As the making of the hall goes on, the ants bite
off with their jaws bits of dirt, and roll them up
with their feet. They soon use the hind part of
the body to press and push the earth into a firm
ball. These balls are carried out and laid by the
door. By degrees the balls form the “ant-hill.”</p>

<p>When the hall is two or three inches long, they
make a room. Then they make more halls and
more rooms. The rooms are for eggs, for larvæ,
for pupæ,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and for food.</p>

<p>People who have studied much about ants have
had them build nests in glass jars. Thus they have
been able to see how they work.</p>

<p>To make a room, the ants often have to stand on
their hind legs, and bite the earth off, as they reach
up their heads. Sometimes the ant lies on its side,
to clean off or smooth the side wall. They have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
been seen at work, lying on their backs, as men do
in mines.</p>

<p>The jaws of the ant have tiny teeth. In old work
ants the teeth are often quite worn off. The feet
and jaws of the ant are well made for digging.
The feet have small hairs. By the aid of these
the ants can run up a piece of glass, or hang on a
wall, as you would say, “upside down.”</p>

<p>An ant-hill is made of very many little halls and
rooms. Some open into each other; some do not.
The rooms are bedrooms, nurseries, pantries, and
dining rooms. Many of the rooms are shaped like
a horseshoe. Some are round.</p>

<p>The ants press and knead the floors and walls to
make them hard and smooth. Sometimes they line
them with a sticky soil, like paste, to keep the earth
from falling in.</p>

<p>Some ants seem to make a kind of glue, or
varnish, with which they line their walls.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE ANTS AT HOME.</p>


<p>We have taken a look at the ants and have seen
how the hill is made. Let us now see how the ants
live in their hill-home.</p>

<p>When we go to visit them, we shall find ants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
running all about the hill and in the halls. These
are the work ants. Some seem to stand on the hill
to watch lest any danger may come near.</p>

<p>When the drone ants and the queens are young,
the work ants let them go out and fly. When they
go out, the drones do not often come back. They
get lost or die.</p>

<p>The young queens come back, except those who
go off to make new hills. But when the young
queen settles down in life, to her work of laying
eggs, the workers do not let her leave the hill any
more.</p>

<p>How do they keep her in? If she has not taken
off her pretty wings, they take them off and throw
them away! If she tries to walk off, a worker
picks her up in its jaws and carries her back.</p>

<p>The ants are kind to their queen. They feed her
and pet her, and she becomes very lazy. She does
not even care to lay her eggs in a nice clean
place.</p>

<p>The idle queen drops her eggs anywhere. The
kind worker ants pick them up, and take them to
a soft bedroom.</p>

<p>When there are too many young queens in one
hill, they do not have a war, as the bees do. The
workers settle the trouble, by taking off the wings
of some of the young queens, and turning them into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
work ants. This is done before the queens begin
to lay eggs.</p>

<p>New-born ants and queens, who do not go out
into the sunshine, are of a light color. The other
ants are dark.</p>

<p>In cold, wet weather the ants stay at home. If a
rain comes up when they are out, they hurry back.
Early in the day, and late in the afternoon, they all
seem to be very busy. In the hot hours of the day
they stay in the hill and rest.</p>

<p>In very hot lands the ants stir about all winter.
Such ants lay up stores of food. You shall hear of
them by and by. In cooler lands, during winter,
the ants are asleep, or, as we say, are torpid.</p>

<p>The young swarms usually go out in autumn. I
have seen very large swarms in the spring.</p>

<p>Ants like sugar and honey best of all food. They
get honey from flowers, and in other ways of which
I will soon tell you. Some like seeds which have a
sweet taste. For this reason they eat some kinds
of grass-seeds, oats, apple-seeds, and such things.</p>

<p>Ants take their food by licking it. Their little
rough tongues wear away bits of the seed; they
also suck up the oil and juice. They seem to
press the food with their jaws.</p>

<p>It has been found out that they know how to
moisten their food and make it soft. If you give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
them dry sugar or cake, they turn it into a kind of
paste or honey. Then it is easier to suck or drink
it up.</p>

<p>If you put a nest of ants with plenty of earth
into a large glass jar, and put some food near by
for the ants to eat, they may settle down in the jar,
to make a home. If you cover the outside of the
jar with thick, dark paper, the ants may build close
to the glass. Then, when you take off the paper,
you will be able to see the halls and storerooms.</p>

<p>You might put such a jar in a safe place out of
doors. Then you would be able to study the ants,
as they roam around near by, or do their work
inside the jar.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_V">LESSON V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE ANTS ON A TRIP.</p>


<p>The round hole in the ant-hill is called the gate.
The ants can close it with a bit of stone. Often
there are two, three, or even more, gates for one
ant-hill. Once I saw a hill with six large gates.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you of a very queer ant-hill. It
was made by big black ants, in a little valley
between two hills of sand.</p>

<p>Into this valley had blown a very large sheet of
thick paper. It had been around a ham and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
very greasy. It had lain on the ground, crumpled
up, in sun, and snow, and rain, for a year.</p>

<p>By that time it was hard and stiff, and weeds had
grown up about it. One day, as I was going by, I
saw ants running in and out of the folds of the
paper. I took a stick and turned the top fold open
like a lid.</p>

<p>It was full of ants and of white pupa-cases. The
ants, I think, liked the folds of the paper for halls,
and the larger wrinkles for rooms. They had found
out how to have a house without much work in
making it.</p>

<p>When I opened this paper-hill, they ran in
swarms to pick up the white bundles. Poor things!
They did not know where to go for safety. So I
laid the lid of their house back in its place, and
soon they were quiet again.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you how ants move from one
house to another. One day I saw by my garden
path a line of ants moving all one way. They
were black ants.</p>

<p>They went two by two, or one and two, close to
each other. Every one had in its jaws a white
bundle. I found that they all came from an ant-hill.
They came up out of the gate very fast, one
by one, each with its bundle.</p>

<p>About two or three inches from this line of ants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
I saw another line. This line went <i>to</i> the hill, not
<i>from</i> it. They went in good order.</p>

<p>They had no bundles when they went into the
hill; when they came out, each had a bundle, and
joined the other line of ants.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp96" id="i_025" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">On the March.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I went along with the stream of ants that had
the white bundles. I found that they went to a
new hill, about thirty feet from the old hill.</p>

<p>There they laid down their bundles, and went
back to the old hill to bring more. The bundles lay
heaped in a ring all about the gate of the new city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>Out of this gate ran other ants in haste. They
caught up the bundles, one by one, and carried
them in. In about half an hour they were nearly
all taken in, and the ants brought no more. The
moving was over.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp98" id="i_026" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_026.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">On the March.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With a long blade of grass, I gently took up a
little bundle, I hid it behind a stone, some six
inches off. I took three bundles and hid them, lifting
them with the tip of the grass-blade.</p>

<p>When all the bundles left at the hill were carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
in, the ants went down the gates. But in a minute
out came three or four ants. They ran about wildly
and searched the ground.</p>

<p>They went in circles and looked over the ground
with much care. The circles grew wider. At last
one came up behind the stone and found the bundles.</p>

<p>The ant picked up one bundle and ran. Then
this ant met the other ants, and, I think, told them
the news. For at once the other ants ran up to
the stone, and each took up a bundle.</p>

<p>Then they all ran into the hill. Can ants count?
That looked as if they knew how many bundles
they had. It also looked as if they knew that two
ants must go for two bundles.</p>

<p>A man who took bundles from a march in this
way thinks that the ants smell the hidden bundles.
He says they will not search for them if you hide
them in the earth.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE FARMER ANTS.</p>


<p>You have heard of the spider which makes a den
in the ground. You know that it puts a trap-door
on its den, and plants ferns on the door to hide it.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_028.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">The Little Farmer.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The spider turns
gardener in this way,
and all his plants grow
well. There is an
ant that has a farm,
or garden.</p>

<p>This ant lives in
warm lands. In this
country they are
found in Texas, Florida,
and in one or two
other warm States.</p>

<p>These farmer ants
raise grain to eat.
The grain is a kind
of grass with a large
seed. It is called by
some “ant-rice.”</p>

<p>There is also a
large ant which is
fond of the seeds of
the sunflower. It is
said that the ants
plant the sunflowers
in a ring around their
hill.</p>

<p>The ants have not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
been <i>seen</i> to carry the seed and plant it. So we may
not be <i>quite</i> sure that they do so. Perhaps they
build where they see young sunflower plants growing.</p>

<p>It is possible that the ant plants seeds of some
kinds. You see there
are yet in the world
many things left for
you to find out. It
will be well for you to
keep your eyes open.</p>

<p>The farmer ants do
not live in a small
hill that you could
cover with your hand.
Their hill, or disk, is
sometimes flat, and
sometimes high. It
is often as large as
a large room. It is
in the shape of a
circle.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp59" id="i_029" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_029.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">An Ant’s Grain Field.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this circle all weeds and all kinds of grasses
are cut down, except the one kind which the ants
like. The earth of the disk is kept clean and
smooth. Only the seeds of the ant-rice are left to
grow.</p>

<p>When the ant-rice is ripe, the ants pick up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
seeds as they fall, and take them into the hill to
their storerooms.</p>

<p>It is most likely that as the ants let this ant-rice,
and nothing else, grow on their hills, it sows itself
by its fallen seed.</p>

<p>Still the ants are real farmers, as they keep their
land clean, tend and gather the crop, store it up,
and eat it.</p>

<p>When the ant-rice is ripe, and the seeds have
fallen, the ants cut down the old stems, and take
them away. The disk is then clean for the next crop.</p>

<p>The ants will go a long way from their hill to
find seeds to bring home. They like to go where
horses have fed, for there they find scattered oats.
In some lands they carry off much grain from the
fields.</p>

<p>An ant in Florida climbs the stalk of the millet
and cuts off the seeds. When ants take seeds to
their hill, they husk and clean them. They throw
bad seeds away.</p>

<p>The ants watch the seeds, and after rains carry
them out to dry in the sun. This is because if left
wet, they would sprout and grow.</p>

<p>Some ants also cut the seed, so that it will not
sprout.</p>

<p>The ants eat the seeds that they gather. They
also feed their young with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>One ant in Florida rolls up into little balls the
dust, or pollen,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of pine cones, and stores that up to
eat.</p>

<p>An ant in New Jersey cuts in pieces the little new
pine trees, just as they get above the ground, and
carries them to its nest.</p>

<p>Did you ever see the ant which likes sunflower
seeds to eat? It is a large ant, and when it has
climbed to the disk of the sunflower, it pulls out
one of the ripe seeds and carries it away.</p>

<p>When people keep a nest of ants in order to watch
their ways, they feed them with sugar, oats, apple-seeds,
and wheat.</p>

<p>How does the ant eat the hard grain? Its tongue
is like a file, or something like that of the little shell-fish
of which I told you.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The ant can rasp, file, and
press the grain, so it can get at and lick up the oil
and juice.</p>

<p class="ph3">ANTS AND THEIR TRADES.</p>


<p>Since you know that bees, ants, and wasps<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> all
belong to the same great family of living creatures,
you will not wonder that many of their ways are
alike.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>
<p>You know there are wasps and bees that live alone.
You have read how, in the spring, Mrs. Social
Wasp builds her home and raises a brood of babies.</p>

<p>These, as soon as full-grown, begin to build more
rooms and nurse the next babies. Mrs. Ant does as
Mrs. Wasp does.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ant begins a new hill, and as her children
grow they help her. But Mrs. Ant does not often
begin her hill in the spring. She chooses the early
fall to begin work.</p>

<p>As the eggs change into working ants, Mrs. Ant
gets plenty of help in her work.</p>

<p>You have seen bees swarm, and hang in a bunch,
or curtain. Ants also cling together and form balls.
But this is for warmth or safety. It is called “snugging.”
In some lands, in times of flood, ants form
balls as large as your play ball. Thus they can
float on the water, and do not drown.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Wasp makes paper, so Mrs. Ant can
make a thin paper, for her nest. But it is poor
paper, not so good as Mrs. Wasp makes. Mrs.
Wasp is the chief of the paper-makers.</p>

<p>I told you how one Mrs. Bee cuts leaves to line her
nest. So one Mrs. Ant does. With cut leaves she
lines a neat little nest. As the spider makes a fine
spun ball to put her babies in, there is an ant that
makes a woolly nest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>You have read of the Tower Spider, that builds
a neat tower of sticks, straw, and grass over her nest.
There is an ant that thatches its hill in much the
same way.</p>

<p>There is a brown ant that is a mason. She makes
her nest of little balls of mud, laid up like bricks in
a wall.</p>

<p>Then there is a carpenter ant, as there is a carpenter
bee. These carpenters cut their way into
trees and logs. These ants hollow out the inside
of a tree, or beam, until it is ready to fall to pieces.
In this way they do much harm.</p>

<p>Besides their other trades, the ants know the trade
of war. There are soldier ants. Ants are mild and
kind to each other while at work. But they are
brave, and have armies for war.</p>

<p>It is odd to see how much ant ways and ant
soldiers are like human ways and human soldiers.</p>

<p>The ants make war to get slaves, or servants. I
will tell you more of that in the next lesson. They
also make war to get cows, as you will hear by and
by. They seem to have some other reasons for
war.</p>

<p>When the ant army marches, it keeps in line and
order. It seems to have captains to rule and lead it.
Scouts go before to seek out the way.</p>

<p>The ant-hill has some soldiers for sentries, to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
that no danger comes near. When a work ant gets
into trouble, it will run to a soldier for help.</p>

<p>The soldier ants do not appear to be cross. They
have very large heads, as if they wore big hats.
Some of them have smooth heads, and some hairy
heads. They eat much and love to sleep.</p>

<p>The soldier ants do not do much work. They
rouse up only for a battle. In an ant-hill, the soldiers
are larger, and often more in number, than the
other ants.</p>

<p>The workers are the smallest ants in a hill.
There are fewer queens than any other kind, except
after most of the drone ants go off and die.
At that time there are very few drones.</p>

<p>In a battle, two ants will often cling to each other
by their jaws, until both die. The usual way in which
an ant soldier kills a foe is by cutting off the head.</p>

<p>Sometimes the battle ends without any killing.
At other times the ants are very fierce, and large
numbers are cut to pieces.</p>

<p>When strange ants get into a hill, sometimes they
are driven out; sometimes they are killed; sometimes
they are treated kindly.</p>

<p>I put a black ant into the gate of a city of brown
ants. You should have seen how they drove him out!
He ran as if he were wild with fear. Three or four
brown ants came after him to the edge of their hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>But though some strange ants are cast out so
fiercely, there are two or three kinds of beetles which
go into ant-hills and live with the ants. The ants
do not harm them in any way. You shall hear
about that when we have some lessons about beetles.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE SLAVE ANTS.</p>

</figure>

<p>Now I must tell you about the slave ants and
their owners. The chief family of the slave-making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
ants is called “The Shining,” for its body shines
with a gloss like varnish.</p>

<p>The slave-making ants and their slaves are found
in many parts of the world. The masters are of a
light or red color, with a bright gloss. The slave
ants are dark or black.</p>

<p>In nests where slaves are held the masters never
do any work. They make war and steal slaves, or
slave babies. The slave ants do all the work. If a
war rises, they also fight for the hill and their owners.</p>

<p>The army of the slave makers will march to the
hill of a tribe of ants which they wish to seize for
slaves. They carry off the pupa-cases, where the
little new ants are getting legs and wings.</p>

<p>These baby ants are taken to the hill of the
owners and brought up with their own young. No
slave-ant eggs are laid in a hill, for the queens lay
all the eggs, and the queens are not slaves. The
slaves are stolen when they are eggs, or larvæ.</p>

<p>The owners seem to be very kind to their little
slaves, and as the slaves grow up and fill the hill
they seem to do very much as they please.</p>

<p>The slaves build new hills and take their owners
to live in the new home. If a mistress ant wishes
to wander off her hill, her slaves drag her back. If
she does not wish to move to her new home, her
slaves carry her off, all the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>The slave-owning ants walk about their hill in an
idle way. If war comes, then they fight bravely.</p>

<p>The owners do not build the house, nor nurse
their babies, nor feed themselves. Often they do
not even clean their own bodies. They leave all
these duties to the slaves. The slaves feed their
owners, and brush and clean them, as a servant
cleans his master’s coat. When the ants are to
make a move, the slaves pick up their masters, and
carry them away.</p>

<p>How can they do that? The ants carry all burdens
in their jaws. The slave and the master lock
their jaws, the owner curls up the back of her body,
and the slave carries her off.</p>

<p>The grip of an ant’s jaw is very strong. She can
carry things much larger than her own body.</p>

<p>There is an ant which uses the pine needles for
food. She carries the bits of pine laid over her
back much as a man carries a gun. There is a
little groove in this ant’s head, where the bits of
pine rest. I have seen very large hills covered with
carefully cut bits of pine needles. I think they have
been sucked dry and then cast out.</p>

<p>There is an ant called the “parasol ant,” because
it cuts off tiny bits of leaf, and carries them along.
Each ant holds a piece of leaf over its head, like a
parasol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>An army of this kind on the march looks very
funny. These ants line their nests with bits of leaf,
to keep the dirt from falling in.</p>

<p>These parasol ants are very large. Their nests
cover a large space. The bits of leaf are cut about
the size of a dime. The ants carry them in their
jaws, each piece by a little end left for a stem.</p>

<p>We have some parasol ants in this country, in
Florida and Texas, and there are many of them in
South America.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">WONDER ANTS.</p>


<p>You may perhaps read of what are called “Termites,”
or White Ants. You must not think that
these are true ants, for they are not. They belong
to another Order of insects. They have four wings
all of the same size. But true ants have one pair
of wings smaller than the other.</p>

<p>The white ants live in the ground and also in
trees. They do much harm by gnawing wood and
trees. They swarm into houses, and eat the tables
and chairs and such things. They eat all kinds of
food. They are much like real ants in their ways.
There are many of them in our country.</p>

<p>Now you must hear about the ants that keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
cows. I have told you that ants like honey. They
take all their food by lapping and sucking it. They
suck honey from flowers.</p>

<p>If you look at the plants in the garden or house,
you may see on the leaves some very small green
things, that seem to eat the leaves. Your mother will
tell you these are “plant lice,” and that they spoil
her plants.</p>

<p>The name of this little insect is Aphis. That is
a very pretty name. The aphis is very small, and
is often of the color of the leaf it feeds on.</p>

<p>This wee thing can make honey in its body much
as bees do. But the aphis does not store up the
honey; it drops it on the leaf as it feeds. This is
called “honey dew.”</p>

<p>The ants eat the honey dew from the leaves, and
they know that it comes from the aphis. They
stroke and tap the aphis with their feelers, so that
more dew will be let fall.</p>

<p>Have you seen the milkmaid go from cow to cow,
and fill her pail with milk? So the ants go from
one aphis to another, until they get all the honey
they want.</p>

<p>The ants can carry home this honey, and give
it to other ants. The nurse ants will carry it to
the baby ants. The workers take it to the queens,
owners, and soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>The aphis is called the “ant’s cow.” A hill of
ants will seem to own a herd of these wee green
cows. They go to them on their leaf, and get the
honey. They know and claim their own cows. It
is just like having a drove of cows in pasture, as
the farmer does.</p>

<p>You know that people often keep cows in stables
and feed them there. The ant has this way also.
There is a kind of aphis that loves the dark and
feeds on roots. Some ants keep a herd of these,
hidden in the ground. They pet, stroke, and clean
them to get their honey dew.</p>

<p>Ants have been seen to fight for days over a herd
of aphis-cows. One hill of ants had no cows, and
they tried to steal the cows that belonged to another
hill. After four days the lady that watched
them got twenty cows, and gave them to the hill
that had none. Then the war ended.</p>

<p>The ants which got the new cows seemed very
glad. They licked and petted the cows, and put
them in a safe place. They took honey from them
and fed the soldiers.</p>

<p>This seems just like a fairy tale. But it is quite
true. All these things can be seen if you look out
for them. But you must be patient and anxious to
learn.</p>

<p>In warm summer days, when your mother tells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
you that it is too hot to run about much, what will
you do? Why not make a tent of an umbrella,
placed near an ant-hill, and watch these pretty and
curious little creatures?</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_X">LESSON X.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE WAYS OF ANTS.</p>


<p>I have told you that ants like honey and sweets.
They will also suck the juices and soft parts of
many other kinds of food. Some ants eat nearly
everything that can be eaten.</p>

<p>Almost all ants will eat other insects, and suck
the eggs or pupæ of other insects. This habit
makes ants very useful. Certain worms and bugs
that destroy orange trees and cotton plants are
killed by ants.</p>

<p>Ants also eat other insects that injure men. If
a coat that has these on it is laid near an ant-hill,
in an hour or two the ants will have made it
quite clean.</p>

<p>You have seen a fly sit and clean her body and
wings. She does this by drawing her feet over her
head and body. So you have seen the cat clean
her fur coat with her paws and tongue. The ant
washes or brushes herself in just such a way.</p>

<p>The ant is very neat and clean in her habits. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
takes many naps in a
day, and after each
nap she brushes herself.
She brushes herself
tidy after work
and after taking food.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp27" id="i_042" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_042.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Queer Capers.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The action of the
ant in cleansing herself
is much like that
of the cat. The ant
has on her fore-leg a
little comb, shaped
like your thumb.
With this she strokes
and combs all dust
and dirt from her
body.</p>

<p>If you watch an ant
as she dresses herself,
you will see that she
draws her fore-foot
through her mouth.
This is to clean the
comb and to make it
moist, so that it will
do its work well.</p>


<p>The ant has also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
little brushes on her
other feet; so you
see there is no reason
why she should not
keep herself very
trim and tidy.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp26" id="i_043" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_043.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Queer Capers.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Ants are very neat
about their nests.
They carry out all
husks of grain and
seeds and all dead
bodies. They carry
these quite off their
hill.</p>

<p>I knew of an ant’s
nest that had been
set on a post in
water. It was kept
clean by the ants.
They soon learned to
drop all refuse over
into the water. That
is as the sailor does,
when he tidies his
ship.</p>

<p>Ants bury their
dead. When an ant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
dies, some of the other ants pick up the body to
carry it off and bury it. They do not like to put
dead bodies near their hill. The ants will carry
the dead ones round and round, till they find a
good place for them.</p>

<p>A lady who spent much time in the study of ants
said that the slave-owning ants do not bury the
slaves with the masters. They put the dead slaves
in one place and the owners in another.</p>

<p>Ants will now and then change their home.
They leave an old hill and make a new one. When
they do this, if some of the ants do not seem ready
to leave the old hill, the others drag them off by
force.</p>

<p>Most ants have very good eyes, and can see above
ground and under ground. But there is one kind
of ant that is blind.</p>

<p>Ants can bite with their sharp jaws. They also
have a sting. They seldom use it if they are let
alone. Some ants have quite a sharp sting. The
sting is on the hind part of the ant’s body. Their
sting is made in three parts. There is the sack for
poison, the needle which gives the prick, and the
case to keep the needle or prickle in. This needle,
of a light color, is like a little thorn.</p>

<p>The ant seizes with its jaws the part which it
wishes to sting. Then it lifts its body up on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
hind legs, and swings its sting part under, so that it
can drive the sting into the place held by the jaws.
The sting does not do much harm to people, but
will no doubt kill ants and other insects.</p>

<p>Ants make also a kind of juice called “ant acid.”
They can throw this about when the hill is disturbed.
This acid must be pretty strong. It will
make a dog sneeze and rub his nose. The ant uses
it to keep dogs, mice, beetles, and such things, away
from the ant-hill.</p>

<p>I have told you that some ants harm trees and
plants by gnawing or cutting them. It is only fair
now to tell you that ants help plants to grow. As
they creep into flowers for honey, they carry about
from flower to flower the dust or pollen which
makes new seeds grow. This dust sticks to the
ant’s body, and what is taken from one flower is
carried to another. Bees also carry pollen.</p>

<p>Thus, you see that the ants help the flowers,
which in their turn give food to the ants. But, of
course, the ants do not know what they are doing
for the flowers.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Nor do the bees know that they
help the flowers. The bees and ants do not know
that pollen sticks to them, to be carried about.</p>

<p>These lessons about the ant contain only a few
of the many things that can be said of this insect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
I hope you will like the ants well enough to get
other books about them, and study and watch the
ants for yourselves.</p>

<p class="ph3">MR. WORM AND HIS FAMILY.</p>


<p>One day I saw a boy making a hole in the
ground, and he dug out a worm.</p>

<p>I said to the boy, “What can you tell me about
worms?”</p>

<p>The boy said, “Worms are long, soft things,
alike at both ends. If you cut one in two, each end
goes off, and makes a whole new worm. They
have no heads and no feet and no feelings, and are
no good but for fish-bait.”</p>

<p>The boy thought he knew all about worms. But
really he knew very little about them. All that he
had told me was wrong.</p>

<p>Worms belong to the great class of ringed, or
jointed, animals. These creatures have bodies
made in rings or joints.</p>

<p>Let us take a careful look at our humble friend,
the earth-worm.</p>

<p>He is a long, round, soft, dark, slimy thing, and
you say, “He is alike at both ends.”</p>

<p>Is he? Let us see. His body is made of from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
one hundred to two hundred rings. These rings
are smaller toward the two ends of the body, which
are the head and tail.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="i_047" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_047.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Like and not Like.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each ring has on it tiny hooks, too small for you
to see. These hooks take the place of the jointed
feet that his cousins have. The feet on a caterpillar
will show you about how these hooks would
look, if you could see them.</p>

<p>By these hooks the worm moves along, and digs
his way in the ground. Mr. Worm can hold so fast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
to his den or hole, that you have hard work to pull
him out.</p>

<p>Have you seen Mr. Robin brace his feet and tug
with all his might, when he pulls out a worm? The
worm is holding fast by his hooks.</p>

<p>You see the hooks are Mr. Worm’s feet. Let us
now look for his head. You have five senses. You
can hear, see, feel, smell, taste. The worm can feel
and taste. Some think he can smell some things.
Some say that he cannot see or hear. I think that he
hears, but maybe what makes him come up to look
about is not hearing, but feeling a jar on the ground.</p>

<p>Why do we say he has a head, if he has no eyes
nor ears nor nose? We say he has a head because
he has a mouth and a brain.</p>

<p>His mouth has two lips. The upper lip is larger
than the under. He has no teeth. In the back of
his head, not far from his mouth, is his brain, or
nerve-centre.</p>

<p>The worm is the only jointed animal that has red
blood. Mr. Worm is dark-colored because his body
is full of the earth which he swallows.</p>

<p>If you keep him out of the earth for a while, his
skin will get pale and clear. Then you can see his
red blood run in two long veins. He needs fresh
air to keep this red blood pure. He dies very soon
if he is shut up in a close box or case.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_XII">LESSON XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">MR. EARTH-WORM AT HOME.</p>


<p>I told you the earth-worm has two veins. One
runs down his back, the other runs along the under
side of his body.</p>

<p>There are tiny holes, like pin pricks, in his body.
These are for the air to reach his blood, to keep it
red and pure.</p>

<p>In his body poor Mr. Worm has something that
no other creature has. He has two bags or sacks
for lime. This is in some way to help him with his
food.</p>

<p>Mr. Worm has no teeth with which to grind his
food. He has inside his body small bits of stone.
These are as small as grains of sand. They are instead
of teeth to grind his food.</p>

<p>When you study birds you will find that, like Mr.
Worm, they have no teeth. They, too, carry little
millstones inside their bodies.</p>

<p>The little bags of lime help to grind or change
the worm’s food in some way, not yet well known.</p>

<p>The soft body of the worm will stretch like India-rubber.
It will hold a great deal of food.</p>

<p>Now you see that Mr. Worm is <i>not</i> alike at both
ends. One end has the head, the stomach, the parts
that serve for a brain, and a heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>The hooks begin at the fourth ring behind the
head. Look at the worm when he lifts his head,
and you will see his mouth.</p>

<p>The tail end has very strong hooks with which to
hold fast to his cell. This tail end is also his trowel,
or mould, a tool with which this poor, ugly worm
helps to build the world.</p>

<p>Ah! now I have told you a great thing, a strange
thing. Is it true that the feeble, useless worm helps
to build the world? Where is that boy who knew
so much about worms?</p>

<p>But before you hear how the worm helps to build
the world, let us go back to what the boy said. He
said, “If you cut the worm in two, each end will go
off and be a whole worm.”</p>

<p>That is not true of the worm. When the worm
is cut in two, the parts do not die at once. As there
are hooks and rings on each part, they each can
move off.</p>

<p>It is thought that if the fore part is left safe, the
cut can close up, and the worm can still live. A
new tail may grow upon the front part, as Mr.
Crab’s new claw or eye-peg grows.</p>

<p>The hind part cannot live and grow. It cannot
get a new mouth or heart, so it can take no food,
and have no blood. It soon dries up and dies.</p>

<p>The boy told me that the worm “had no feelings.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
A worm can feel. The sense of touch is the best
sense it has. Put your finger on its body, and see
it move and shrink.</p>

<p>If the worm can hear, the organs that serve for
ears have not yet been found. It crawls up as you
come near, and pokes its head out of its hole and
wags it to and fro. It has felt the jar of your steps.</p>

<p>The worm cannot see. Creatures that live under
ground have but little use for eyes. Fishes that live
in dark cave-rivers have no eyes. If the worm moves
from the light and hides from it, it is because it feels
the action of light on its skin. It does not see the
light.</p>

<p>What does Mr. Worm eat? Some tell you that
he eats dirt. It is true that he fills his body full of
earth. That is to carry it to the top of the ground.
Mr. Crab has claws and legs to bend into the shape
of a basket. Poor Mr. Worm has no arms, legs,
or claws, so he must make a basket of himself.</p>

<p>Suppose you should be sent for fruit, and turn
yourself into a basket in that way! Your mamma
might find fault. She would not wish you to act
like a worm.</p>

<p>It is true that the worm may find a little food in
the earth which he swallows. But the chief food of
the worm is dead leaves and stems of plants. It does
not care for fresh, live leaves and stems and roots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>The worm also likes meat,—fat, raw, or cooked.
Worms will gnaw or suck the bodies of dead worms.
We say worms <i>gnaw</i>. As they have no teeth,
they do not really gnaw. They pinch off what
they eat.</p>

<p>Worms like onions and cabbage best of all food.
They need plenty of water, and must live in damp
places. They soon die if they are put into water.
They choke as a fish chokes if kept out in the air.</p>

<p>When the worm gets food into its mouth, the
rings of its body begin to move out and in. They
look as if they were opening and shutting. By this
motion they press the food down into the body.</p>

<p>When the worm wants to move, it stretches out
its body to its full length. Then it takes hold of
the earth with its hooks. Next it draws up its
body, and so moves on. This is a wave-like motion,
you see. Watch it, and you will see that it
travels with a motion like waves.</p>

<p>If you wish to find worms to study, you must
seek for them in early morning or late in the evening.
You will be likely to find them when all the
earth is moist with dew, or when it is raining. They
avoid heat and sun.</p>

<p>Worms hurry to the surface of the soil to enjoy
the falling rain. When there is a long, dry time,
the worms go down deeper and deeper into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
earth. You cannot find them when you dig for
them. They need to keep down where the earth
is moist, soft, and cool.</p>

<p class="ph3">MR. WORM AT WORK.</p>


<p>Worms are found in all parts of the world. I
have told you that they help to build the world,
and make it fit for the home of man.</p>

<p>Man cannot live without food. He gets his food
from the earth. The worms help to prepare the
earth to bring forth the food of man.</p>

<p>Oh, this is very strange, that humble and dirty
worms can be a help to man! Man is the highest
of all animals. Worms are nearly the lowest. And
can worms help man?</p>

<p>Now let us see how this is done. The worms live
under ground. They make long, winding halls, like
streets, some inches below the top soil. These halls,
or little tunnels, help to keep the earth loose, so that
the fine roots of the plants can grow well in it.</p>

<p>These tunnels also serve to help the air move
more easily through the soil. By their constant
motion below the surface the worms till the earth,
as rakes, spades, or ploughs till it above.</p>

<p>All this is of great use, and people say, “Many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
worms, rich land.” Now and then you will hear, on
the other hand, that the worms have eaten up the
seed sown. Or, people say the worms have bitten
off the roots of the plants. Some say that the
worms cut the vines below the soil.</p>

<p>You need not think the earth-worms did that.
Not at all! The earth-worms never behave so ill.
The “worms” that people mean, when they speak
of this harm done, are the grubs or larvæ of some
insects, as of the daddy-long-legs and others.</p>

<p>These grubs and cut-worms will eat living plants,
but Mr. Worm likes dead leaves and stems best.
He wants his food made soft by decay.</p>

<p>Now we come to the chief work of the true earth-worms.
When they make their halls and houses,
they fill their long bodies with the earth. Some
say it is their food.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin says, “Oh, no! they fill their bodies
with earth just to get it out of their way.” If they
get any food from the dirt it is not much. They
turn themselves into baskets to carry the dirt out
from their houses.</p>

<p>The worms work, work, work all the time, taking
out earth, and carrying it to the top of the ground.</p>

<p>There they pile it in heaps, called worm-casts.
Each piece is the shape of a small worm.</p>

<p>The earth takes this shape as the worm presses it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
out of its long, soft body. Early in the day you can
find these worm-casts over all the garden paths. So
you can after a rain. Go and look for them.</p>

<p>There are so many worms busy all the time that
each year they bring up tons of earth. This shows
you the power that is in small, weak things. In
India there are worm-casts in heaps six inches high.</p>

<p>The worms make the earth fine and loose, by
pinching it off with their mouths. Then they bring
this rich soil from below, and lay it on top, and so
on and on.</p>

<p>It is only some twenty years since this work of
worms was known. At first people said, “Oh, no,
no! It cannot be that little, soft worms could cover
a great field, some inches deep, with new earth.”
But it was shown to be quite true.</p>

<p>Fields once stony and hard have become rich and
fine. Things grow now where once scarcely anything
would grow. Ashes and gravel, once on top,
go two or three inches below.</p>

<p>All this is done by the busy worms. That is why
I said that you could call the tail end of the worm
the tool with which he helps to build the world.</p>

<p>Worms at work under ground have caused great
walls and pavements to sink, as the earth sinks
over mines. Also, they have helped to bury ruins
and old cities, and to keep them safe hidden, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
we found them. We are glad when we learn of
the old world days, from ruins which the worms
helped to hide.</p>

<p>Then, too, the worms help make the soil rich, by
the dead leaves and stems which they drag into
their holes to decay. When the worms die, their
bodies also help to make the earth more fertile.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">MR. WORM’S COTTAGE BY THE SEA.</p>


<p>On the seashore you will find two or three kinds
of worms. These are called “Tube Worms,” from
the shape of the houses which they build. Some of
them are called “Swimming Worms.”</p>

<p>The swimming worm is cousin to another family
of creatures which look like worms, but have many
feet. They have a name which means “many feet.”</p>

<p>You know that on most of the rings, in the body
of the worm, are hairs or hooks. You can see how
easy it would be for these to become feet.</p>

<p>Each animal seems to have parts that are like
some other animals, and some new forms of its own.
Thus, next the worm, with his rings and hooks,
comes another animal with rings and feet. Of all
the ring animals, Mr. Worm is the pattern, and
after him comes his cousin, Mr. Many-Feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>While Mr. Many-Feet is like Mr. Worm, he is
also like Mrs. Fly, and seems to come between the
two, a little related to both.</p>

<p>Now let us look at the seaside worms. Here we
find some worms that have eyes. We also find
some that have little hard teeth, set in a ring inside
their mouths. There are some that have fine
plumes, as gay as any bird. These poor worms
gleam like a rainbow.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp91" id="i_057" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_057.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Are they Cousins?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>New parts can grow on these worms as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
on the earth-worm, or even better. Some say that
they can even get a new head if the old one is lost.</p>

<p>Some of these worms can bore into very hard
things, as wood or stone. Some of them shine like
a fire. Ask some one to tell you of this kind of
light; it is like what we call Jack o’ Lantern.</p>

<p>Dig in the sea sand anywhere, and you will find
worms, black, brown, green, red, orange. They dig
through sand and mud, and move very fast.</p>

<p>It is not yet known how these worms bore into
stone and wood. Perhaps it is by means of some
acid stuff in their mouths. Perhaps it is by a file,
such as Mr. Drill has.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>If you look along the sea sand of some shores,
you will find the tube-homes of these sea worms.
In their way of making a shell-home, and making it
larger as they grow, they are like the little shell-fish
you have read of.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Most of these tube-homes are small, but some are
very large. A gentleman told me he had one with
the bore or hole as large as his arm.</p>

<p>These worms by the sea serve as food for many
fish and other creatures. You know that nearly all
fish like to eat worms, and that they are used for
bait. The boy who knew nothing else about worms
knew they made good bait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>He would have been full of wonder if I had told
him that large worms are used for food by men in
some parts of the world. In this country we do not
make use of such food.</p>

<p class="ph3">MR. WORM AT HOME.</p>


<p>Baby worms are just like the parent worms, only
smaller, and with not so many rings. As they
grow, they get more rings by the dividing of the
last one.</p>

<p>In some kinds of soil the wee worms are born in
a little hard skin bag. This keeps them from
harm, until they get strong enough to take care of
themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. Worm’s home is like a row of long halls.
These halls are lined with a kind of glue from the
worm’s body. This glue makes the walls firm.</p>

<p>The halls are not deep under ground. If the
weather is very cold, or very dry, the worms dig
down deeper. Worms dislike cold or drought. They
enjoy warmth. They also like water, and wet soil.</p>

<p>When winter comes the worms plug up the doors
of their houses. This is done by dragging into the
doorway a plant stem that will fit and fill it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>The worms carry into their homes leaves and
stalks to eat. They bring out, and throw away,
things which they do not like. Worms show much
sense in the way in which they carry things in and
out of their holes. If a stem will not go in, they
turn it over, and try it in some other way.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="i_060" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_060.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Mr. Worm at Home.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Worms usually come out of their holes at night
or in wet weather. If they go far from their house,
they cannot find their way back. Then they make
a new hole. Each worm lives alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>Often in the evening or early morning, or during
rain, you will see worms near their houses. You
may find them with their heads just put out of their
doors. You will see the worm casts in early day
or after rain. It is then the worms dare to come
out. Sun and heat dry worms up very fast, and so
kill them.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="i_061" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_061.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Mr. Worm leaving Home.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The birds know all these ways of the worms.
Watch a robin or a bluebird. He searches for his
food at sunrise, or after sunset, or while it rains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>Now his keen eyes see the worm at his door! In
goes his sharp bill! He pulls like a good fellow!
He is hungry. He wants his breakfast. The
worm holds fast by his hooks. The bird braces
his feet and his tail, and tugs hard. Out comes the
worm to feed Mr. Bird.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The bird shows great skill in the way he pulls
the worm out of the hole. He does not break off
even one little bit of his soft body. No boy could
get him out in that way.</p>

<p>Some say that the worm lies by his door at sunrise
for warmth. I do not think that is so. I think
what he likes is the fresh dew. He loves dampness.
He fears cold, but he also dies of heat.</p>

<p>Any worm will die in one day in dry air, but
some kinds of worms will live for weeks quite down
under water. He needs an even, moist warmth.
His home must not be hot, nor cold, nor dry.</p>

<p>Little young worms know how to dig houses,
make worm-casts, carry out the soil, find food, and
plug up the door of their houses. They know at
once all that old worms do. But then worm houses
do not require as much skill as bee or wasp houses.</p>

<p>The seaside worms make the prettiest houses.
On shells, stone, wood, or wound alone in a lump,
you will find their tubes. They are white and as
hard as shell. Inside they are pink or blue.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>
<p>These tubes curve and twist about, as the worm
went that built them. Some are very pretty.
There is a soft kind of tube made of sand and bits
of shell, stone, and weed. The sand and weed are
held together by a kind of glue. The worm makes
this glue in its mouth.</p>

<p>I have some tubes very clear and white. You
can see the lines where the worm went when he
built them, ring by ring. Some of these tubes are
so small you can just run a fine needle into them.
Some are as large as a straw, and some as large as
a fine fat earth-worm.</p>

<p>Now you see how much is to be learned, even of
such a small humble thing as a worm. Think how
much even such a weak creature can do!</p>

<p>There is much more to be found out about
worms, which I hope you will be glad to learn for
yourselves.</p>

<p class="ph3">A LOOK AT A HOUSE-FLY.</p>


<p>Look at a worm crawling about on the earth.
Then look at a fly with blue or green body and
thin wings. See how it whirls in the air! You
will say, “These two are not at all alike.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>Yet there is one time in a fly’s life when it is
very like a worm.</p>

<p>For this reason many wise people set flies and
worms next to each other when they study them.</p>

<p>You know, as soon as you look at a fly, that it is
an insect.</p>

<p>You have learned that an insect has wings, six legs,
a body in three parts, and a pair of feelers like horns.</p>

<p>Insects breathe through all the body, and not by
lungs as you do. They have a row of holes in
each side to breathe through.</p>

<p>The life of an insect passes through three states.
These are the egg, the grub or worm, and the
pupa. When it is in the pupa it gets legs and
wings. The word “pupa” means <i>baby</i> or <i>doll</i>.</p>

<p>There are some kinds of insects that vary in some
of these points. The fly is one that varies from this
rule.</p>

<p>If you look at a fly, you will see that it has two
wings, not four. It is not one of the hook-wings.</p>

<p>Many insects can fold their wings. The fly cannot
fold its wings; it lays them back over its body.</p>

<p>Let us first look at a fly when it is most like an
earth-worm. The fly comes, in the first place, from
a tiny egg laid by the mother fly.</p>

<p>When the egg opens, the baby fly is not like a
fly, but like a little earth-worm, both in its looks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
and in the way in which it is made. It is a small
white worm with rings, and on the rings are hooks.</p>

<p>If you wish to watch this change, lay a bit of meat
in the sun on a hot day. Soon flies will lay eggs on it.</p>

<p>The next day these eggs will be turned to grubs,
which grow very fast. The fly’s eggs are small and
white, and are put upon the meat as if they had been
planted on one end.</p>

<p>The worm of the fly has a pair of jaws like hooks.
It has two little dots which will become eyes when
it has grown to a fly. In the hooked jaws and these
eye-points it is not like an earth-worm.</p>

<p>The fly grub eats and grows. Then its skin gets
tough and hard, and forms a little case like a barrel.
This shuts the worm in it, as in a coffin. Now the
baby fly seems to be dead.</p>

<p>But it is not dead. It is turning into a creature
that has wings and legs, and can fly and walk.</p>

<p>As the fly lies in its case, first the legs and then
the wings grow. It gets a head with mouth, eyes,
and a trunk or tube, and from a poor worm it turns
to a wonder, as you will see.</p>

<p>But in its little coffin it is shut close, and its legs
and wings are all bent up. In a few days the change
is made. Now it is ready to come out.</p>

<p>It moves, and pulls, and gets free from the hard
case. Then it strikes the end of the case with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
head time after time. At last it breaks the case
open, and out comes the fly!</p>

<p>Then it stands in the air, and in the sun if it can,
and shakes itself. It is cold and weak; but the air
dries its wings and blows out the wrinkles.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes the fly is strong and gay.</p>

<p>Then it spreads its wings and sails off to enjoy its
life, and to look for something good to eat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_XVII">LESSON XVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">HOW TO LOOK AT A FLY.</p>


<p>Do you think a fly is a very small and common
thing? Is it not worth looking at? Let us see
about that.</p>

<p>First, here is its head with two great eyes. We
will soon look at the eyes. Then you will see how
curious they are.</p>

<p>There are, besides the big eyes, three little eyes.
These are set on the top of the head. Then, too,
on the front of the head we find a trunk or tube.
And here is a pair of feelers. Inside the head is the
brain, very much like a worm’s brain. It is only a
tiny white dot.</p>

<p>Next behind the head is the chest. The head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
has the shape of half of an egg laid sidewise. The
chest is nearly square. It is made of three rings.</p>

<p>On the first ring is a pair of legs. On the next
ring is a pair of legs and a pair of wings. The fly
has only one pair of
wings.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp49" id="i_067" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_067.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">On the Wing.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the last ring is
a pair of legs. And
near these legs are two
little clubs covered
with fine hair. It is
by means of these
clubs that the fly can
halt or balance on the
wing. They help the
fly as the second pair
of wings helps other
insects.</p>

<p>The third part of
a fly’s body is the
largest. It is egg-shaped, and joins the chest
by the thick end. This part also is made of
rings.</p>

<p>Now let us look at the head of a fly. The feelers
are like two long, fine plumes made in joints. Most
people think these feelers are made to touch with.
Their full, true use is not yet known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>You see, even in a fly there is much left for some
of you to find out.</p>

<p>Some people think that flies smell and hear with
these “feelers.” But then they are so fine that a
breath can jar them, and the fly might <i>seem</i> to hear
when it only feels.</p>

<p>I know of something else like that. It is this.
In some schools for the deaf and dumb, the pupils
are called to class or table by rapping on the floor.
The deaf do not hear the noise, but they feel the
jar, and come as if they could hear.</p>

<p>Let us look at the mouth of the fly. The lip of
a fly runs out into a long, slim tube or pipe. With
this it sucks up its food.</p>

<p>At the end of this tube is a little flat plate. Close
by it are two sharp hairs. These are to prick the
food, so that the tube can suck it more easily.</p>

<p>When the fly is not eating, it can shut up this
tube like a telescope, to keep it safe. Did you ever
see an elephant? Did you see his trunk? The
fly’s tube is his trunk. The elephant’s trunk is his
long upper lip. So is the fly’s trunk a long lip.</p>

<p>The chief parts to notice in a fly’s head are its
eyes. These are so large that they make up nearly
all the head.</p>

<p>These big bright eyes look as if they had varnish
on them. Now each of these eyes is made up of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
very great many small eyes. There are four thousand
of these small eyes.</p>



<p>Between these two big eyes are three little
single eyes, set in this way—</p>

<figure class="figright illowp100" id="i_069" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_069.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Wise men have studied the eyes
of flies for many years, and do not
yet know all about them.</p>

<p>The wings of a fly have a fine, thin, clear covering.
This is held out on a tiny frame, like a net-work.
The fly moves these wings very quickly.
The motion of the wings helps to make the sound
or <i>buzz</i> of the fly.</p>

<p>Now we come to the legs and feet of our fly.
The leg is made in five joints. The foot also has
five joints. The last joint of the foot has two claws
and a little pad. These are covered with fine hairs.</p>

<p>The hairs catch on little points or rough edges.
Thus the fly can walk, as you would say, “upside
down,” and does not fall. Besides, the pad and
hairs act like a sucker. They suck air from under
the foot. So they hold the fly from falling as he

<p>I suppose you have heard your mother wish there
were not so many flies. The fact is, flies make us
much trouble. Their noise tires and vexes people.
They lay eggs in and on the food, and so spoil it.
They cover our clean walls and glass with small
black spots.</p>

<p>Will you wonder that there are so many flies
when I tell you that one fly can in one season be
the mother of two million others!</p>

<p>Many insects die soon after laying eggs. Bees
and wasps do not, nor do flies. Bees and wasps
take care of their eggs and their young, but the fly
mother does not.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fly has more than a hundred eggs to lay at
once. It is quite plain she could not take care of
so many babies. She must let them all look out for
themselves.</p>

<p>Still Mrs. Fly shows much sense as to where she
puts her eggs. She finds a place where they will
be likely to live and get food and grow.</p>


<p>If the place is too wet the baby flies would drown
when they leave the egg. If the place is too dry,
they would wither up and die. Then, too, they
must have soft food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>The fly does not
lay her eggs on a
stone or a piece of
wood. She lays them
in some kind of food.</p>

<p>The fly can live all
summer if it has a
fair chance. Cold
kills flies. A frosty
day will kill them.
Some few flies, like
a few of the wasps,
hide, and live over
winter in a torpid
state, and in the
spring they come out
to rear new swarms.</p>

<p>Birds, spiders,
wasps, cats, dogs, and
some other animals
eat flies. These creatures
kill flies by millions.
People kill flies
with poison and fly-traps.
If so many were
not killed, we should
be overrun with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>In the South is a plant with a leaf like a jug. On
the seam of this leaf hang drops of honey. Its
juice can make the flies drunk.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Flies like this juice. But as soon as they get it
they turn dizzy and act just like drunken men.
They fall into the jug-like space of the leaf and
soon die. One of these plants will kill many flies
in one day.</p>

<p>Many of our best birds live on flies, and if our
birds were all dead we should have much greater
trouble with the flies.</p>

<p>In the autumn you will see flies sitting about as
if they feel dull and ill. If you look carefully you
will see that the back part of the body is white. It
seems to be covered with meal or mould.</p>

<p>Soon the fly dies. This white dust is a disease
of the fly. It does not curl up its legs when it dies
from this cause. They are stiff and spread out.
The fly looks like a live fly. If you touch it, it
crumbles to dust.</p>

<p>All around such a dead fly you will see a ring of
white mould. This is perhaps a real mould, or tiny
plant, that seizes on the body of the fly. It uses up
all the soft parts, and so kills it, leaving only the dry
shell.</p>

<p>There is another strange thing about this. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
body of a fly that dies in this way is rent or burst
open. The fly looks as if this dust or mould had
grown large in the body and so torn it open.</p>

<p class="ph3">OF WHAT USE ARE FLIES?</p>


<p>How often people cry out, “Oh, I wish there
were no flies! What is the use of a fly?”</p>

<p>But all things that God has made have their uses.
And all God’s works are worthy of study.</p>

<p>You have learned that worms are of great use.
Let us see if Mrs. Fly does any good in the world.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fly is of great use to man. She helps keep
him in health. Do you think that very strange?</p>

<p>People say, “Oh, these <i>dirty</i> flies!” And yet
these “dirty flies” help to keep the world clean!</p>

<p>Now you know that over all the world, great
numbers of animals die each minute, and many of
their bodies lie on the ground and decay.</p>

<p>Such bodies in decay cause disease and death to
men. In winter, and in cold places, such things do
not decay so fast, and so do not make these bad odors.</p>

<p>But in hot days, if such dead things lie about,
they will poison the air. Soon we should all
be ill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>The work of Mrs. Fly is to lay many eggs in
these dead bodies. In a few hours these eggs turn
to grubs, and these grubs to little live worms, which
begin to eat as fast as they can.</p>

<p>Soon they leave only dry bones, which can do no
harm. They change the dead stuff into their own
fat, live bodies.</p>

<p>You know that the crabs are among the street-cleaners
of the sea. So the flies are among the
street-cleaners of the air and land.</p>

<p>Did you ever watch flies dart about, here and
there, with a flight like hawks? They are eating
up small, evil things, too small for us to see. But
these are yet big enough to hurt us if we should get
them into our lungs.</p>

<p>Ask your teacher to tell you a little about your
lungs.</p>

<p>In and about our homes many bits of things drop,
and might decay and mould. This would make the
air foul. But the busy and greedy fly drinks up all
the soft part of these things.</p>

<p>So we see that what we call the dirty flies help
to clean away much dirt. It is true too, that flies
carry poison on their feet and trunks from place to
place. In this way they do great harm.</p>

<p>The fly serves for food for many birds, and fish
and frogs, and some insects. Some of these things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
we use for our food. Others are full of beauty, or
are of use to us, each in its own way.</p>

<p>Thus, though the fly is often a trouble to us,
we find it is not without its uses. Look at one of
these little creatures through a glass that will magnify
it. You will see that the poor insect has really
much beauty.</p>

<p>From what you have read in this lesson you must
not think that all foul smells kill, nor that things
that have no bad smell are always safe. There are
some gases that have no odor at all, which yet are
very deadly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_XX">LESSON XX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">A SWARM OF FLIES.</p>


<p>Have you heard people speak of swarms of flies?
By a swarm of flies we mean a great number of
flies rather near together. By a swarm of bees we
mean a number of bees that live and work in one
place. A swarm of bees divides the work of its
hive. It has one queen bee. She is the mother
and ruler of the rest.</p>

<p>But flies have no home where they live in common.
They have no work. They have no one
mother or queen, for whom the rest work. Each
mother fly drops her eggs where it seems best to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
her. Then she goes off. She leaves her children
to grow as best they can.</p>

<p>I have said that the fly likes best to place her
eggs on a piece of fresh meat.</p>

<p>These eggs soon turn to worms or grubs, and so
spoil the meat. To keep the meat from the flies
the cook puts a cover over it. The cover is often
made of wire net.</p>

<p>“Now,” says the cook, “I can keep away that
dirty fly.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Fly says, “Oh, can you, Mrs. Cook? We
will see about that.”</p>

<p>So Mrs. Fly sits on top of the wire cover. She
puts her little egg tube through one of the fine
holes in the net. She drops egg after egg from the
tube. The eggs fall right on the meat, just where
Mrs. Fly wishes them to be.</p>

<p>Then the cook cries out, “How <i>ever</i> did that fly
get to my meat?”</p>

<p>Is it not strange that Mrs. Fly knows that her
egg tube is the right size to go through the mesh
of the wire net? How does she know that the
eggs will fall on the meat?</p>

<p>Flies do another queer thing. If many flies are
in a room, and you begin to chase them to kill
them, they hide. They creep into holes and cracks.</p>

<p>They hide in curtains. They go behind pictures.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
After the hunt is over, out they come, one by
one!</p>

<p>Flies also know how to sham death, “play
dead,” you would say. If you hit one and make it
fall, it will lie very still, and seem to be dead. Then,
after a little, it softly spreads out its legs and its
wings. Then it shakes itself. A moment more, off
it goes.</p>

<p>This fashion of making believe to be dead does
not belong to flies only. Nearly all insects, and
many other animals, sham death. It is worth while
to watch and see how well they do it.</p>

<p>When a fly is killed other flies come to eat up
its body. They put their trunks or mouth tubes on
the dead fly and begin to suck. Soon the body is
sucked dry of all its juice. It is only a dry shell.</p>

<p>I will tell you something that you can do with a
dead fly. If it has not been dead so long that it
has grown too stiff you can make the wings move.
Hold it by the body. Gently tip up one wing. As
you lift up one wing the other will rise too. They
move together. It is as if they were set on a little
spring.</p>

<p>It is as wrong to be cruel to flies as to larger creatures.
If they are to be killed, do it quickly, and
give as little pain as possible. If we do cruel acts,
we make our hearts hard and bad.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">SOME QUEER FLIES.</p>


<p>Although flies are of use, they also do evil to
men in many ways. It is well to look at things on
all sides.</p>

<p>The fly you have been reading about is the common
house-fly. That fly, with its noise, dirt, and
spoiling of food by laying eggs in it, is bad enough.
But yet the house-fly makes the least trouble of any
of its kind.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of flies. To the family of
flies belong gnats, midges, mosquitoes, and the big
daddy-long-legs with wings.</p>

<p>You know well how some of these things sting,
you say “bite,” you. Mr. Daddy-long-legs hurts the
grass lands with his grubs, which spoil grass roots
and the shoots of plants.</p>

<p>There is a fly called a “gall-fly” because it bites
trees, and lays eggs in twigs. Then upon the twigs
grow over the eggs round balls called “galls,” and
these injure the trees.</p>

<p>There is also the “bot-fly,” which lays its eggs on
the hide of the horse. The egg causes the skin of
the horse to itch. He licks the place, and the egg
goes into his stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>The egg of the bot-fly is apt to make the horse
sick. The grub eats holes in the stomach of the
horse. That makes the horse sick. The farmer
will say that his horse is sick with “bots.”</p>

<p>In Africa flies kill horses and oxen by biting them.
The bite poisons the cattle and causes fever.</p>

<p>Farmers will tell you of a very bad fly that spoils
wheat and other grain. It is called the “Hessian” fly.</p>

<p>Flies, as they flit from place to place, sometimes
carry with them the poison of disease, as of sores
and ulcers. Thus they spread these troubles among
people.</p>

<p>But while I tell you of that, I must not fail to say
that flies, as they go to flowers for honey, carry
the dust of the flowers from one to another. This
helps new flowers to grow.</p>

<p>There is a large and handsome bright green fly,
very fine to look at, which bites horses and worries
them. It is called the “horse-fly.” In some lands
a small sand-fly causes sore eyes.</p>

<p>Flies have been on the earth about as long as
men have, or a little longer, and there are some
dead flies worth a great deal of money.</p>

<p>How is that? These are flies in amber. Amber
is clear, hard, and bright yellow. It is used for
jewelry. Sometimes we see a perfect fly, held in a
clear, light mass of amber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>How did it come there? The amber was once a
soft gum and the fly lit on it. It stuck fast, and
the amber flowed over it and grew hard, and so
buried the fly in a clear, golden tomb. A piece of
amber with a fly in it will bring a high price.</p>

<p>The “Spanish fly” is a large blue-green beetle.
It is very handsome, and is most useful when it is
dead. It is used in medicine. It makes blisters on
the skin.</p>

<p>Do you say, “Oh, blisters are very bad!” Yes,
they cause pain. But even pain can be of use in
this world. The blister, though it pains us, is of
use. It cures what might be a worse pain.</p>

<p>This Spanish fly is not a fly at all. It is a beetle
which has been given a fly’s name. It is put here
at the end of the lessons on flies, because in the
next lessons you are to read about beetles.</p>

<p class="ph3">IN ARMOR CLAD.</p>


<p>Go to the garden or to the house plants, and
after a little search you will find one of the wonders
of the world.</p>

<p>You will find a small, horny, shining, red thing
with black spots on its back. “Why!” you say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
“that is only a lady-bug, or lady-bird. We say a
little rhyme to it.”</p>

<p>The rhyme is—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Lady-bird, lady-bird,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fly away home!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your house is on fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And your children will roam.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yes, it is one of the beetles, and every beetle
is a wonder. Come, study this wonder.</p>

<p>The winged insects are divided into two great
classes, Eaters and Drinkers. That is what their
Latin names mean. Butterflies, house-flies, bees,
and others, are drinkers. That is, they get their
food by sucking it through a pipe or tube.</p>

<p>This tube is on the fore part of the head; it is
really the upper lip grown long and round.</p>

<p>The other great class, the Eaters, eat their food
with their mouths. Some suck or lick it; some
use their jaws to crush and break their food.</p>

<p>Beetles belong to the class Eaters.</p>

<p>The beetles are covered with a hard, horny shell,
like a case. In this they are like the old-time
soldiers, who wore armor from head to foot.</p>

<p>Beetles belong to the great family of the ring-made
creatures. Take a large, round beetle, with
big jaws, feelers, and legs. Does he not look much
like Mr. Crab, who is also ring-made?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>In the pictures in this lesson you see Mr. Crab
and Mr. Beetle. This is a large beetle that likes
to live among the grasses and weeds near the seashore.
When he and Mr. Crab meet on the sand
they may think they are cousins.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_082.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Mr. Beetle.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now let us get a beetle and look at him closely.
You will often find dead beetles on your path or
in the grass. You can take them to pieces and
compare them with what you read about them.</p>

<p>The first thing that you will notice in the beetle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
is the hard case over the wing. The wing-cases
look like little shells, and have a nice hinge to hold
them in their place.</p>

<p>These two wing-covers fit close to each other
over the beetle’s back. When he flies he lifts them
away from the wings. When you take off these
covers you will see lying under the cases a pair
of neatly folded wings. These wings are made
much as Mrs. Wasp’s are.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="i_083" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_083.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Mr. Crab.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The cases are used for armor, not for flying.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
They are really a pair of wings. The fine silken
under-wings are the pair with which beetles fly.</p>

<p>There are some beetles that do not have this
second pair, and so cannot fly. There are some
that have the upper pair so short that they do not
half cover the body. Beetles which do not have
the lower wings creep from place to place.</p>

<p>Watch a beetle as he crawls on the ground.
Now see him! When his back flies open two
bright-hued shells rise up. This crawling thing
sweeps into the air on a pair of wide thin wings!</p>

<p>The part of the beetle’s body that is under the
wings has rings like those of the wasp. The body
is made in the three parts insects have. The wings
and six legs are fastened on what you would call
the chest or middle part.</p>

<p>The wings fastened on the upper or back part of
the beetle’s chest fold down over the hind part of
the body. On the end of the hind part is what
is called “the egg-placer.” With that Mrs. Beetle
lays her eggs in safe places.</p>

<p>The legs and feet of the beetle are made in
joints. They have hairs on them. The legs are
so made and set that they cannot spread out as far
as those of spiders, wasps, flies.</p>

<p>Now here is Mr. Beetle’s head. It has two jaws
and two feelers, the mouth, and the eyes. There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
a little horn shield over the mouth. In fact, the
whole beetle is in a snug horn coat. We may call
this coat a suit of armor.</p>

<p>The eyes of the beetle are like those of the fly.
Very many eyes are set in what seem to be two big
eyes. The beetle does not have three single eyes on
the top of his head. Sometimes he has two small
simple eyes at the back of his head.</p>

<p>The splendid colors of Mr. Beetle are on his horn
coat. I caught a beetle last night which had the
under part of his breast covered with close hairs,
so that it looked like velvet. He seemed to have
on a rich brown velvet vest.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Beetle Larva before it has Wings.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the lessons about the Ant, Fly, Wasp, Bee,
and others, you have heard that the young insect
makes three changes.</p>

<p>First it is a small white or light-colored egg;
then a fat, greedy larva; then a pupa.</p>

<p>The insects you have thus far heard of, pass
through all these changes in a short time. So do
some of the young beetles. But there are beetles
which spend one, two, three, even more, years, as
eggs and grubs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>



<p>The long part of
the lives of these
other insects comes
after they get their
wings. The short
part of a beetle’s life
generally comes after
he is winged.</p>

<p>You will not care
to hear about the
beetle while he is
only an egg. As an
egg he lies quiet
where the mother
beetle hid him. These
eggs are placed in
earth or in water.
Sometimes they are
put into the bodies of
dead animals, or into
holes in trees, or into
fruit. Some kinds of
beetles choose one
place, some another,
for their eggs.</p>


<p>After a while the
larva comes out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Sometime you may find a long, soft, stupid white
worm, with its body made in rings. It has two big
eyes, two jaws, no feet, or, perhaps, very small ones,
never any wings. Would you guess it was Mrs.
Beetle’s child? By and by it will have strong wings,
long, strong legs, a horny body, and very often colors
like a rainbow.</p>

<p>But this which you call a “white worm” is the
beetle larva after it is born from the egg. Sometimes
it has no eyes. It is always very greedy.
Beetle larvæ will eat almost anything but metals.
They harm wood, trees, fruit, flowers, meal, furs,
clothes, by gnawing and eating these things.</p>

<p>The larva of beetles looks like the larva of butterflies.
It has no wings. No larva ever has wings.</p>

<p>The change of getting wings must come when the
larva has gone into the pupa cradle. Often in this
state it lies as if asleep or dead.</p>

<p>When it is a pupa it rests in a case or cradle
shaped much like a hen’s egg. There the pupa lies,
its legs folded over the front of its body, its wings
packed by its side, its jaws and feelers laid on its
breast. It looks very much like a baby laid asleep
in a bed. It is not pretty like a dear baby. In fact,
it is ugly to look at.</p>

<p>The larva could eat, walk, roll, or swim. The
pupa in this little case can do nothing but wait.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
The full-grown beetle can fly, swim, eat, walk, and
is often a thing of great beauty.</p>

<p>If you dig about the roots of plants or under
stones, you will, no doubt, find larva and pupa to
look at. It is well to seek out these things for
yourselves. Handle them gently; these are living
things.</p>

<p>In some books you may read of a state of the
insect called the image state. This name is given
to the full-grown, perfect insect. It means that it
has reached the same form that its mother had,
which laid the egg. Larva means mask, and pupa
means baby.</p>

<p class="ph3">HOW TO LEARN ABOUT BEETLES.</p>


<p>No class of insects has been more studied and
written about than beetles. Why is this? They
are not as wise as the ants. They do not build
homes and cities, as bees and wasps do. They
make no honey and no wax. They have not the
many trades of that busy Mrs. Wasp.</p>

<p>There are a few beetles which make little mud
cells, or balls of dirt for their eggs, or weave little
nests for the pupa. But their work is poor and rude
and not as fine as Mrs. Wasp can do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>No doubt the reason why beetles have had so
much notice is, that there are very many of them, of
very many kinds. They live where we can often
see them. We can easily take them to pieces, to
study their parts, for their bodies are firm and
strong.</p>

<p>The parts of their bodies are very curious. Beetles
can be kept a long time after they are dead.
They will not spoil as soon as soft-bodied insects.</p>

<p>After all, the chief reason of the notice taken of
beetles is their great beauty. It is a beauty of color
and shape. Often the cases are lined and dotted as
if carved with great care.</p>

<p>Would you like to have some beetles to keep, to
look at and show to your friends? Let me tell you
how to get them.</p>

<p>Have a sheet of thick pasteboard, to fasten them
on. When you walk out, carry with you a bottle
with a wide mouth and a good cork. If this bottle
has broken laurel leaves in it, the beetles will die as
soon as you put them in.</p>

<p>Or, you can kill the beetles with a little ether.
Or, you can take up the beetle with a little forked
stick, and plunge it into very hot or boiling water.</p>

<p>“Oh,” you say, “that would be so cruel!” But the
truth is, the beetle dies the instant he is plunged
into hot water. He has no time to feel pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>Why do these things kill beetles so quickly?
Here, now, is a great fact that you must know. The
insects do not breathe through the mouth or nose,
as you do. They have no lungs. They breathe
through pipes or tubes, wound over all the body.
These tubes are very fine, and too small to be seen
with the naked eye. They are
held open by a little stiff, spiral
thread, like this:</p>

<p>These tubes spread even to the legs and feet of
the insect. They reach the open air by many openings,
or breath holes. Now, when you plunge the
beetle into hot water, ether, or laurel odor, all its
tubes are filled, and it dies at once. When your
beetle is dead, set it on the sheet of stiff paper.</p>

<p>Draw the legs, feelers, and jaws into place with
a pin or toothpick. Then fasten the beetle to the
paper with a tiny drop of thick glue put under the
body. Or, you can put a fine needle or pin through
the body. Be very sure that your beetle is quite
dead before you put the pin into him.</p>

<p>If you take this way of saving beetles, you will
soon have very many, of all colors, sizes, and shapes.
They will be brown, black, red, green, golden. I
can hardly tell you how pretty the beetles are!</p>

<p>Put some on the paper, with the wing-cases
raised, and the flying-wings drawn out from beneath.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
The under wings are larger than the upper.
You will wonder that the beetle can pack them in
the cases.</p>

<p>The feelers of beetles take many forms. Some
are like plumes, some are like scales or leaves,
some like clubs. Some are nearly round like
balls, some are cone-shaped, some plain and
straight; some are bent like a new moon.</p>

<p>A farmer or gardener will like your beetles better
dead than alive. As he will tell you, the beetles
and their larvæ are very greedy things. They often
eat leaves and spoil crops and trees.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE ROSE BEETLE.</p>


<p>The chief family of the beetles is a large one.
It is found in all parts of the world. The beetles
that belong to it are large, and often of fine color
and shape.</p>

<p>In old times the people of Egypt called one of
this family the sacred beetle. They kept it as an
object of worship. They often wore a stone or
metal image of it, to keep themselves from harm.</p>

<p>Let us now study one of this family. It is called
the Rose Beetle. That is a very pretty name. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
beetle itself is pretty.
It chooses a pretty
home and dainty food.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp26" id="i_092" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_092.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">The Rose Beetle.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some call this the
Golden Beetle, because
of its color.
It is a fine large
beetle, with a thick
body, round at the
tail part. The feelers
are short and club
shaped. The body,
head, legs, and wing-cases
are a rich golden
green, with silver
spots and lines.</p>

<p>This beetle does
not hold the wing-cases
apart when it
flies. It tips them
only a little. The
wide, thin wings come
out from beneath
them.</p>

<p>The rose beetle is
seen most in May
and June. You will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
find it in the garden, about the flowers. Its chief
food is honey and flower petals. Its mouth is not
horny, but soft and skin-like.</p>

<p>The feelers have ten joints, and wave lightly as
the beetle flies. It likes the sunshine. When it
flashes about in the light, it looks like a piece of
melted gold with green tints on it.</p>

<p>The rose beetle chooses for its home and food
the brightest and largest flowers. It digs deep into
the hearts of the roses. It sucks the honey and
chews the petals.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp68" id="i_093" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_093.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>When the mother rose beetle wishes to lay her
eggs, she finds a place at the foot of a tree. She
goes down among the roots,
where the wood is old and
soft. Then she puts her eggs
between the bark and the
wood.</p>

<p>Sometimes she changes her
whole plan, and puts her eggs
into an ant’s nest! The ants
do not seem vexed at this.</p>

<p>The larva of the rose beetle is a fat, round, white
thing, like a thick worm. The head is round, and
of a pale brown color. The thin skin has hairs
on it.</p>

<p>These larvæ move very slowly, and always rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
upon one side. They have strong jaws, and their
feelers have five joints. A number of them live
together. They are dull and lazy, and always eating.
They eat leaves and soft wood.</p>

<p>While the weather is warm, the larvæ keep near
the top of the soil. When it is cold, they dig down,
even one or two feet, and lie asleep until spring
comes again.</p>

<p>They live in this way for three years. Then they
make a round or egg-shaped ball. They make the
ball of grains of earth, bits of dead leaves, and grass.
Or, they use the wood or sawdust they have cut up
with their jaws. They fasten all this stuff together
with glue from their mouths.</p>

<p>When the larvæ are shut up in this ball, they
change very quickly. At first the ball, or case,
seems full of a milky fluid. Then the legs and
wings grow. After a few weeks the white worm
has changed to a fine beetle that looks like a jewel.</p>

<p>Some of these beetles are so fine that they are
put into hoops of gold for ear-rings and brooches.
In the island of Manila ladies keep rose beetles in
tiny cages for pets!</p>

<p>There is a beetle much like the rose beetle. It
is called the May or June bug. These June bugs
come in great numbers. They eat the leaves of
trees, and even kill trees in this way. They fly by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
night; and they like to get into a room where a
lamp is burning. They are a golden brown color.</p>

<p>They blunder about, making a great buzz with
their horny wings. They hit their heads on walls
and panes of glass. Some people are afraid of them.
That is foolish, for they can do no harm to them.</p>

<p>These June bugs hide all day in the shade.
They do not like the sun. It is no wonder there
are so many of them, as each mother lays forty eggs.
The larvæ do much damage by eating plant roots.</p>

<p>Watch June beetles to see how they lift their
wing-covers when about to fly. Look well at the
folding of the inner wings.</p>

<p>If you open a door or window on a warm night
and set a light in the room, you may soon catch very
many pretty beetles which fly about to feast on the
sweet white flowers that open after dark.</p>

<p class="ph3">PRINCES AND GIANTS.</p>


<p>Beetles vary much in size. Some are so small
that you can hardly see them as they creep among
the grasses.</p>

<p>Others are so large that a child might fear them.
He might think that with their thick legs and claw-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
feet and strong jaws they must surely be able
to hurt him. But beetles are quiet, mild things,
and seldom pinch or bite anybody.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp91" id="i_096a" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_096a.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Why do these beetles have
these strong coats like mail?
To keep them from harm.
They live under stones, and
among roots, and dig about
in the earth. Their horny bodies protect them.</p>

<p>Many more animals, than now do so, might eat the
beetles if they had not the horny coats to shield them.</p>

<p>Fish, birds, and other animals eat them and their
grubs. Enough are killed and eaten to prevent the
world being too full of beetles.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp100" id="i_096b" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_096b.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Beetles have few weapons. I will tell you of one
or two of them. Stag beetles have very large,
strong jaws, and
can give a good
pinch with them.</p>


<p>One family of
beetles is called
the “Oil family.”
They have an oil
in them. They
drop this from their legs when they are touched.
This oil has a bad smell. It can make a blister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
on the skin. Because of this oil people let them
alone, and perhaps small animals do the same.</p>

<p>There is a beetle that carries a gun! This is
like a gun with several barrels, for it can be fired
three or four times without being reloaded! Oh,
how can that be?</p>

<p>Near the tail of the gun beetle is a little sack or
bag full of fluid. When an enemy comes near him,
Mr. Beetle, as he runs, throws off a drop of this fluid.
The fluid flies out of the bag with a little bang. It
sounds like the report of a tiny gun, and makes a
kind of mist or blue smoke.</p>

<p>Three or four of these shots follow each other.
This beetle is a small fellow. Big beetles like to
chase him. When the wee gun goes off in the big
beetle’s face, the big beetle backs away. Then he
folds down his feelers and stands still. He acts
very much as a dog does when he drops his tail
between his legs and runs off!</p>

<p>These little gun-owning beetles live in damp
places. Often a group of them will hide under a
stone. If you lift up the stone, the poor beetles
are in a great fright. They begin to fire off their
guns like a squad of soldiers.</p>

<p>Now after talking about these little beetles, let
us talk of great ones. I told you some beetles are
very small, and some are very large. One beetle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
is so big that it is called the Giant. Another is
called Goliath, from the huge giant whom King
David slew. Others are called Atlas and Hercules,
from tales told, in old times, of giants.</p>

<p>The very large beetles live in hot lands and are
scarce. Some have the jaws large and curved like
a crab’s claw. At first sight you might think them
crabs. Some of these odd ones are shown in the
picture.</p>

<p>The colors of these great beetles are often very
splendid. Some of them have long horns on the
front of their heads. Some of them have the hind
legs so large, and of such a queer shape, that they
do not look like beetles.</p>

<p>Some of these giant beetles have large teeth or
knobs upon their jaws; they need them to crush
and break their food. These teeth are like the
knobs on Mr. Crab’s claw, which he uses for playing
a tune. The beetle can use his knobs to make
music. Beetles are fond of their own tunes. Often
they make, for hours, a shrill hum, or buzz. They
make this by rubbing their wing-cases.</p>

<p>There is a great beetle in Brazil called the Prince
of Beetles. He gets this name from his size and
beauty. Some of the princes have been sold for
two hundred dollars each.</p>

<p>When you walk in the field, you might carry a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
bottle with a wide mouth. In this you can collect
beetles to study. It may be very pleasant to study
them when you go home. But have something in
the bottle to kill them, for, shut up in a small space,
and frightened, they are likely to pull each other to
pieces.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_XXVII">LESSON XXVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE LITTLE SEXTON.</p>


<p>Once, when I was a little girl, I saw a dark beetle
standing on its hind pair of legs. It was holding
its fore legs clasped over its head, as you can hold
up your hands.</p>

<p>An old man who was near said, “That is a holy
bug, and shows what man ought to do. It is saying
its prayers. People call it the ‘praying beetle.’”</p>

<p>I think the old man meant what he said, but
of course the beetle was neither holy nor praying.
The queer way of standing was only one of the odd
ways of beetles. Now I will tell you of another.</p>

<p>Very often on the road you will see a beetle, or
a pair of beetles, rolling about a small ball like a
marble. The ball is of dirt, or some soft stuff, and
is often larger than the beetle. But she rolls it
with ease, for she is very strong.</p>

<p>The beetle is not playing marbles nor base-ball.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
She is only doing her work. She has been flying
about, looking for a good place in which to lay her
eggs, and now she has gone to work with all her
might.</p>

<p>She lays her egg in a morsel of the stuff of which
she will make her ball. When the larva comes
from the egg, this ball will be its food until it is
strong enough to crawl about and seek food for
itself. The beetle moulds the soft stuff over the
egg, like a pill. Then, as she rolls it about, it grows
larger, as your snowball grows when you roll it
about in the snow.</p>

<p>When the ball is large enough, Mrs. Beetle does
not leave it in the road for wheels to run over or
feet to tread upon. She seeks a place where the
larva may be safe and feed well when it comes from
the egg.</p>

<p>She shows much sense in the choice of a place.
She drags the ball along between her hind feet, or
she pushes it with her fore feet or her hind feet, or
rolls it along toward the safe place which she has
chosen. If the ground is so rough that she cannot
drag her ball, she carries it on her head.</p>

<p>This Mrs. Beetle’s head is flat, and has some wee
knobs upon it. These knobs hold her load firmly
in place as she carries it along. Did you ever see
a boy carry a box, pail, or bundle on his head?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps Mrs. Beetle finds that she cannot, without
help, take her ball to a good place. Then she
flies off, and soon comes back with other beetles of
her own kind. They all help her until her ball is
where she wishes it to be. How does she tell them
what she needs? Who knows that? No one. I
have seen four or five beetles at work on one ball.</p>

<p>When the ball is in the right spot, Mrs. Beetle
digs a hole with her jaws and horny fore legs.
Then she rolls the ball in. She fills up the hole
with earth and presses it down flat.</p>

<p>This is not the only beetle that buries its eggs.
There is another one, called the Sexton Beetle.
When it finds a dead bird, or mouse, or frog, or
other small animal, it sets to work to bury it. It
digs a little grave for it. This is why it is called a
sexton.</p>

<p>This beetle begins to dig under the dead body.
As it takes out the earth, the dead thing sinks more
and more. At last it is deep enough to be covered,
as a coffin is covered in a grave.</p>

<p>In this way this beetle helps to keep the earth
and air clean. Is that why it buries things? Oh,
no! The reason the beetle does this is, it wants to
get a good place for its eggs.</p>

<p>These sexton beetles are black, with yellow bands.
They are rather large, and go in pairs. You might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
think these beetles and the one who makes the ball
would be dirty from their work, but they are not.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp98" id="i_102" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_102.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">The Sexton Beetle.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These beetles have a kind of oil over their bodies.
This keeps any dirt from sticking to them. So,
though they work in dirty places, they are always
clean and bright.</p>

<p>These burying beetles have a keen scent. They
can smell a dead body even if it is a long way off.
Let us watch Mr. and Mrs. Sexton Beetle at work.
Here is a dead mouse. Through the air come flying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
these two beetles. Their wings hum as they
come.</p>

<p>When they alight, Mr. Beetle goes briskly to his
work, and Mrs. Beetle stands looking on. Her work
in this world is not to dig, but to lay eggs. Before
the work begins, they both make a good meal off
the dead mouse. All sexton beetles eat flesh.</p>

<p>Mr. Beetle works a while. Then he drops down
as if very tired, and sleeps. Then up he gets and
ploughs furrow after furrow about the mouse. Mr.
Beetle uses his head for a plough. Now the dead
body has sunk out of sight. Mr. Beetle has put
over it the earth he took out from the grave which
he made. He makes all the little grave smooth and
trim.</p>

<p>But what is this queer little fellow doing now?
He has made a little side door into the grave. He
and Mrs. Beetle walk in. They have gone to take
another meal from the mouse.</p>

<p>When their dinner is over, Mrs. Beetle lays some
eggs in the dead body. She knows that when the
larvæ come from the eggs, they will like to eat the
food which they will find all around them. After
the eggs are laid, Mr. and Mrs. Beetle come out
into the air.</p>

<p>Mr. Beetle fills up the doorway. Then off the
two fly to find other things to bury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>The larva of the sexton beetle looks much like a
beach flea or sand-hopper.</p>

<p>Does the strength of beetles surprise you? They
have strong, sharp jaws. Once I found a fine grass-green
beetle, with silver spots. I wanted him for
my card of beetles. I tied him in the hem of my
handkerchief to carry him home. The hem was
double, but he ate a hole through it; then away
he went.</p>

<p>Once I shut up ten beetles in a box. I forgot
them for two days. When I opened the box, they
were all dead. They had killed each other. The
box had in it only heads and legs and wings. The
last beetle that had been left had lost his legs and
wings. He had won the battle, but died on the
field. Some other great captains have done the
same.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE STORY OF THE STAG BEETLE.</p>


<p>Among the largest beetles that we have in this
country are the Stag Beetles. They get this name
from the size of their jaws.</p>

<p>If you look at the picture, you will see that the
great jaws look like horns. If you should ever see
the head of a stag or deer, you may notice that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
this beetle’s jaws are
very like the stag’s
horns in shape.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp26" id="i_105" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_105.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">The Stag Beetles.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These jaws can
give a very hard
pinch in time of need.
Still you need not be
afraid of the stag
beetle; he will not
hurt you.</p>

<p>The use of these
great jaws is not yet
fully known. You
will see that they
have knobs on the
inner edge.</p>

<p>Only Mr. Stag
Beetle has these
horns. Mrs. Stag
Beetle has small jaws,
and her head is not
so wide as her shoulders.
Mr. Stag Beetle
has a very wide head.
He needs a wide,
strong head to hold
up his big jaws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<figure class="figright illowp57" id="i_106" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_106.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>If you will look at the picture of the beetle in
Lesson XXII.,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> you will see that its feelers are
like a plume of six feathers. These feathers are
so set that the beetle
can fold them on each
other into a single
club, as you can fold
a fan. They are
called scale-feelers.</p>


<p>The stag beetle
has also curious feelers.
They are made
in scales, but he cannot
close them into a
club. The scales are
set like the teeth of a
comb. He has comb-feelers.
Perhaps they are of use to him in cleaning
his body and legs.</p>

<p>These stag beetles during the day crawl about on
trees. They fly by night. Their eggs are usually
laid in the trunks of old oak-trees.</p>

<p>The larva of the stag beetle has six strong legs
and a pair of strong jaws for cutting leaves and
wood. The bark, wood, leaves, and roots of the oak
and willow are its chief food.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>
<p>This larva is very large, and lies with its body
curled in a half ring. If you look at it, you will see
that it has nine round spots down its side, on the
rings of its body. It looks as if it wore a coat with
big buttons on the side.</p>

<p>Now let me tell you a new wonder. These
buttons are the air-holes through which this larva
breathes. Come, let us hear the whole story of the
insect’s breathing.</p>

<p>You know you draw the air in through your nose
and mouth, and this air fills your lungs. You
know also that the insect breathes through long,
fine tubes. They are kept open with a stiff thread,
and wound over all its body.</p>

<p>These tubes have openings for air to pass in and
out. These can open and close. In shape they
are a little like the lid of a glass jar. These are
the holes that we see so clearly along the side of
the body of this larva. Both the larva and the
pupa must breathe, or they cannot live.</p>

<p>The larva of a stag beetle lives and grows for
four or six years; then it passes into the pupa state.
When it is ready to change, it makes a case for
itself of the fine chips, the juice of which it has
been sucking. It binds this sort of coarse sawdust
together with glue from its mouth.</p>

<p>When the stag beetle finally comes from this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
pupa-case, he is a fine-looking fellow. His head
and chest are black, with tiny dots like carving.
His wing-cases are a deep chestnut.</p>

<p>There are some stag beetles that never get the
large, strong horns. We do not know why this is
so. Mr. Stag Beetle with the horns fights with
and beats his cousins who have no horns.</p>

<p>Stag beetles are fond of fighting. They are like
Mr. Crab in that. They have duels with each other.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stag Beetle does not behave in this way.
She looks on at the fight, but takes no part in it.
Her business is to lay eggs in safe places. She
has no time to fight. And then—she has no
horns!</p>

<p class="ph3">MR. BEETLE SEEKS FOR A HOME.</p>


<p>I shall now tell you of a very odd beetle. If ever
you find one of this family, you will say, “This poor
beetle has outgrown his coat!” You will say that
when you see how very short his wing-cases are.</p>

<p>But no! the beetle has not outgrown his coat.
Insects do not grow after they leave the pupa-case.
Mr. Beetle and his coat are both of the same size
that they always were.</p>

<p>In fact, this beetle’s coat was cut short for him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
at the first. It is the fashion in his family to wear
short clothes! The flying-wings of this beetle are
large, but the wing-covers are very short. They do
not cover half the
length of the body.
Yet this beetle can
fold up and tuck his
flying-wings under
the short wing-cases.</p>

<p>Most of the short-coated
beetles are
small. Some of them
are an inch long.
They are very lively
insects. They are very greedy little creatures, too.</p>

<p>Some of these beetles eat only animal food. They
are always busy hunting for it. Others of them
are fond of mushrooms. Some of them have a bad
smell. People do not care to touch them.</p>

<p>Since their hard shell coat is so short, it would
be easy to hurt them. No doubt they have this
bad smell to keep away creatures that would eat
them. The smell keeps them from harm.</p>

<p>The “short-coats” do not all have a bad smell.
Some beetles with long coats have this foul odor.
There are also beetles that smell like roses, and like
musk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>Some of the short-coated
beetles curl
the hind part of their
body over. The end
is held up above their
backs. If they had a
long, hard coat, they
could not do that.</p>

<p>You have read
about the termites,
or white ants.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In
Brazil people may
find one kind of the
short-coat beetle living
in the nests of
the termites.</p>

<p>These beetles that
live with the termites
are very strange animals.
The back part
of their body is too
large for the front
part. It looks like
a great ball, and is
turned up over the upper
part of the back.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>
<p>These are the only beetles that do not lay eggs
and go off and leave them. They keep their eggs
in this large, round part of the body until they
hatch. Then the little larvæ come out alive.</p>

<p>Why do the ants allow these beetles to live with
them? Perhaps it is because they make no trouble
and so the termites do not care one way or the
other. Perhaps, like the little Aphis,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> this beetle
has a way of making honey; if so, it pays for its
house-rent with honey!</p>

<p>There are other short-coat beetles which do not
have these big, round bodies. They lay their eggs
like other beetles, yet they live in ant-hills. Perhaps
these beetles and their larvæ like to feed on
the husks and rubbish they may find in the ant-hill.
The ants do not drive them out.</p>

<p>The short-coat beetles are not the only ones that
take lodgings. Perhaps you may hear your mother
say that “the moths have got into her furs.” If
she looks at the furs, she may find, not only moths,
but small beetles. They are having a fine time eating
up the fur!</p>

<p>Such beetles destroy furs, skins, skin rugs, and
stuffed animals. Their greedy larvæ can make
much havoc. These larvæ are like tiny black
worms. They are fond of ham, bacon, and lard.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>
<p>One very large short-coat beetle is called the
“coach-horse.” The larva of this coach-horse beetle
looks like the full-grown insect. It carries its tail
aloft, in the same way. It can run fast, and seeks
its food all day long.</p>

<p>These larvæ often hide under stones. In the
winter they go deeper under ground. They are
fierce, and they eat animal food.</p>

<p>The baby lives only about three weeks in the
pupa-case. This case is of an odd shape, like a
wedge, with a rounded top. It is of a shining gold
color, and has a plume or crown of hairs in front.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE LITTLE WATER-MEN.</p>


<p>You know of spiders that live on land. You
also know of spiders that run upon the water.
There are also land-beetles and water-beetles.</p>

<p>The water-spiders have rafts, boats, skates, and
diving-bells. They sit and float on lily leaves.
Their homes are cool and bright under the clear,
still waters.</p>

<p>There is also a happy race of beetles that have
all these things. The story of these beetles is like
the story of a fairy prince, but it is a true story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<figure class="figleft illowp26" id="i_113" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_113.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A Happy Race.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>All living things
are fitted for the
places where they are
to live. The animals
that live in cold lands
have thick fur. Birds
are made with light
bodies,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> so that they
can fly easily. The
fish have scaly,
pointed, slippery bodies,
so they can glide
swiftly through the
water.</p>

<p>So you must expect
to find that the water-beetles
are not quite
like the land-beetles.
They have bodies
made fit to live in
their water-home.</p>

<p>If you place a
water-beetle beside a
land-beetle, you will
see that the parts of
the water-beetle fit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
more closely than the land-beetle’s. They join each
other so as to form a smooth, water-tight case.
When we build a boat, is it not our first care to
make it tight, so that it will not leak?</p>

<p>Next you will see that the water-beetle’s body is
longer, narrower, and more pointed in front than
the land-beetle’s. It is made so as to part the water
as it moves along. The water-beetle’s shape is more
fish-like than that of the land-beetle. When we
build a boat, we do not make it broad or square at
both ends. We make the fore-part narrow and
sharp, to cleave the water as the fish does.</p>

<p>As the water-beetles will swim much and walk
very little, their first and second pairs of legs are
small and feeble, but the hind legs are wide and
strong, and reach far back. They are used for
swimming.</p>

<p>Mr. Swimming Crab has broad hind legs, used
for oars or paddles. Mr. Water-Beetle’s legs are
made in much the same way, and have hairs or
bristles upon them.</p>

<p>Though the water-beetles are to walk but little,
they are to fly much, and so their wings are fine
and large.</p>

<p>In fact, the water-beetle likes to fly. Very often
he flies at night, and he seems to delight in a clear
moonlight. Then the water of his pond spreads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
out like a sheet of silver, and the crickets chirp in
the grass. The air is moist and cool; it is sweet
with the scent of flowers.</p>

<p>On such nights the water-beetles rise quite high
into the air, and fly here and there, as if full of joy.
Then they turn, close their wings, and drop into
the water with a plash, like a stone.</p>

<p>When a number of these beetles drop with this
quick plash, what do you think happens? Why,
the green frogs who sit on logs or rocks, with their
big eyes above the water, dive in a great fright. I
wonder if the beetles think it is fun to scare the
frogs? The frogs give a loud croak as they dive.</p>

<p>The larvæ of water-beetles live in the water, as
their parents do. They are very greedy, and hunt
their food as if they were angry. They have large
jaws, shaped like a sickle. Their bodies are long
and narrow, and they have on each side of the head
six tiny eyes.</p>

<p>With so many eyes, they can see all about them,
so they keep out of danger. They also see bugs
which they wish to catch. Their straight, narrow
bodies dart through the water with such quick
motion as Mr. Crab has when he runs on the sand.
They pounce on their prey, and their curved jaws
hold it fast.</p>

<p>Some of these great water-beetles have a sharp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
point, like a thorn, on the under side of the breast.
This is not of use to kill what they eat, or to fight
their enemies. The beetle seizes his prey with his
jaws, or with his fore feet. But if you try to hold
him, then he draws his body back, and drives this
thorn into your hand.</p>

<p>Water-beetles have flat pads on their feet, as
water-spiders do. The hairs on these pads hold
tiny bubbles of air.</p>

<p>When these beetles wish to fly, they do not rise
straight out of the water; they climb up the stem of
some plant. Then, when they are high enough to
make a good start, they spread their lovely wings,
and skim away.</p>

<p>If you watch the ponds, you may see a water-beetle
floating with his head down, and the tip of
his tail stuck out of the water. What does he mean
by that queer action?</p>

<p>He is getting air to breathe. Though he lives
under the water, he breathes air, and he is filling up
his diving-bell; or, rather, he is turning himself into
a diving-bell. How does he do that? Let us see.</p>

<p>This beetle’s wing-covers are air-tight. The
mouths of his breathing-tubes open under the wing-covers.
When he has used all the fresh air he had,
he wants some more. So he comes to the top of the
water, turns his head down, and spreads out his feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
to balance himself. Then, with a little jerk, he
drives out any air that is yet under his wing-covers.</p>

<p>Then he draws in fresh air, shuts his wing-covers
up close, and goes down with plenty of fresh, pure
air to breathe.</p>

<p>I have known people who will shut themselves up
in a room and breathe the same air over and over
again.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The beetle, you see, is more sensible. He
knows that if he is to keep his health and spirits, he
must have good, fresh, clean air to breathe. So he
takes all this trouble to get pure air.</p>

<p class="ph3">WHIRLIGIG BEETLES.</p>


<p>There is a Mrs. Water-Beetle who has on the
under side of her body two little knobs for spinning
silk. These are much like the silk-spinners of Mrs.
Spider.</p>

<p>As soon as this Mrs. Beetle has laid some eggs,
she goes to work, like a good mother, to keep her
babies safe and warm. She spins a little silk ball,
or bag, for the eggs. This ball is water-tight. It is
woven so close that it does not leak. It is so light
that it will float.</p>

<p>There are other beetles, and fish, and frogs in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
water, that are seeking food, and they might eat
these eggs, but will not touch them when in this
tough silk ball. The balls are of a fine bright color,
like gold thread.</p>

<p>Another of the water-beetles makes a little silk
bag, packs it full of eggs, and glues it to the under
side of a leaf of some water-plant.</p>

<p>You know that a fly has a little pair of wings,
called alulets, below its true wings. One of the
beetles has such clubs or alulets. So you see in one
part they are somewhat like a spider, in another
part somewhat like a fly. And some things about
them are like what a crab has.</p>

<p>Among all animals you will find points of likeness
between one creature and another.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a whirligig beetle? He takes
his name from the top, or whirligig, because he spins
round, and round, and round. Go to the pond, and
you will see some of these merry fellows. They
act as if they felt so happy that they could not
keep still.</p>

<p>These whirligigs are of a fine bronze color.
They use their hind legs for oars, and their fore
legs for rudders. They have their eyes divided, so
that each one seems to have a pair of eyes on each
side of its head; one half the eye looks up, and one
looks down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>These are small beetles, and they whirl, whirl,
whirl. Then they stand still for a second. If you
make a dart at them, and try to catch them, you
will find that it is not easy to do so.</p>

<p>These whirlers lay their eggs on leaves above
water. The larvæ spin silk pupa-cases which hang
on leaves, or on stems, above the top of the water.</p>

<p>These and other water-beetles live in ponds or
very quiet streams, not in swift water.</p>

<p>I hope the peep you have had at beetle-life will
make you wish to study it more. Study not so
much in books, as out-of-doors for yourself.</p>

<p>Of what use are beetles? Wise people have not
yet found out very much about the use of beetles.
Some of them, as you have read, devour or bury
spoiled things, that it would be bad to have lying
about on the ground. They help to keep the world
clean.</p>

<p>Some of them eat insects that harm plants.
Some of them make good food for fish, birds, and
other creatures. But very many of the beetles do
much harm to plants, clothes, and other valuable
things. On the whole, I fear that beetles are pretty
rather than useful!</p>

<p class="ph3">WHAT A FISHERMAN TOLD.</p>


<p>One day, on the sea-beach, I saw a man mending
a net. He took from the net two small things like
shells. They clung to the meshes of the net. They
were white and hard. They looked like two or
three shells put one inside the other.</p>

<p>The fisherman said, “There are in the world
more of these things than there are leaves on the
trees, I think.”</p>

<p>“Where do they grow, Mr. Fisherman?”</p>

<p>“It is easier,” said the fisherman, “to say where
they do not grow, unless I just say, they grow
wherever there is sea-water. The pier yonder,
below high-water mark, is covered with hundreds
of them. All the rocks that we see bare at low
tide are white with them. Every log or stick that
drifts on the sea has them on it. All the old shells
on the beach, and many new shells, have dozens
fastened on them.</p>

<p>“I have seen an old King Crab crawl up the
beach,” the fisherman said. “He had his shell so
coated with these things, that it seemed as if he had
two shells, one on top of the other. It was so heavy
that he could hardly walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>“I have also seen them growing in the skins of
whales, and sharks, and other fish. I have sailed
all around the world, and I have found these things
everywhere.”</p>

<p>“What do you call them, Mr. Fisherman?”</p>

<p>“Some call them Sea-Acorns, some Sea-Rose-Buds.
These are pretty names; but Barnacle is
the right name.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, Mr. Fisherman, that they are
cousins of the crabs?”</p>

<p>“I’ll never believe <i>that</i>,” said the fisherman.
“They do not <i>look</i> like crabs. When I was a boy,
folks told me that out of these shells came a little
bird that grew into a goose. I saw a picture once,
of a tree all covered with big barnacles, and out of
each one hung a little bird’s head. Is that tale
true? They were not quite like these barnacles.”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Fisherman, it is not at all true. No
birds grow from barnacles. That is an old-time
fable.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the fisherman, “once in the water I
saw something hanging out of the shell of a fellow
like this. It opened and shut, and looked a <i>little</i>
like a bird’s foot.”</p>

<p>“It was a foot, Mr. Fisherman, but not a bird’s
foot. It was Mr. Barnacle’s own foot, and as he has
no hands, he uses his feet to catch his dinner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>“I know,” said the fisherman, “that horse-hairs
in ponds will turn into long worms. But I never
did think these shells would turn into birds.”</p>

<p>“And horse-hairs will never turn into worms.
Long, thin, black worms in ponds look much like
the hairs of a horse’s tail, so some people think they
must once have been horse-tail hairs. But it is not
so. Horse-hairs are always only horse-hairs, and
worms all come from eggs which were laid to bring
out a worm.”</p>

<p>“It is a pity,” said the fisherman, “that when I
was a boy in school my books did not tell me of
these things. It would have been nice to know
what I was looking at as I went about the world.”</p>

<p>Now let us study these barnacles of which our
fisherman spoke. He told us truly about their
number and where they grow. He told us what
he knew because it was what he had seen.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of barnacles,—those that
have stems, and those that have no stems. The
kind that has no stems is the kind you will see
oftener, though there are plenty of the other kind.</p>

<p>The stemless, or acorn barnacles, are placed flat
upon whatever they grow on. Try to pull one off
a stone. You cannot do it while the animal is
alive. When the animal is dead or dying, you can
move the shell from what it grows upon. After the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
animal has been dead some time, the shells drop
from their places, and leave room for others to grow.</p>

<p>All barnacles do not fix themselves upon dead
bodies, such as stones, wood, or shells. Many of
them fasten upon living animals, and are carried
about with them from place to place. Perhaps
they enjoy travel!</p>

<p>In the North Sea many sharks have barnacles
growing upon them. The stem of the barnacle has
little hollow hairs, and these enter into the flesh of
the shark and hold fast there. Others have been
found keeping house upon the whale’s skin, and yet
others on the shells of turtles.</p>

<p>These barnacles which you find by the shore are
small things, you can hold several of them in your
hand at once. Far down in the ocean lives a
huge giant barnacle, so big that some of you could
hardly lift him.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_XXXIII">LESSON XXXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">MR. BARNACLE AND HIS SON.</p>


<p>The Barnacle has a name which means hair or
ringlet-footed. People thought his little fine curled-up
feet looked like small curls of hair. His body
is like a small bag or sac, with the six pairs of little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
curly feet placed at one end. The body is made of
rings as are the bodies of insects. All the six pairs
of legs are on the chest rings. Each leg has two
joints, and a little branch like a fine fringe. The
hard shelly cover of the barnacle is made of plates
lapped together. When they are closed they look
something like buds on trees, or young pine cones.
When the fringes of the feet wave out between the
edges of the shell-plates, it looks as if the buds were
about to open into flower.</p>

<p>A barnacle is more like his far-off cousin Mr.
Crab when he is little than when he is grown up.
Every grown-up barnacle must be firmly fastened
upon some other body. The barnacles are divided
into two classes, according to the way in which
they are fastened upon objects: 1. Stem Barnacles,
2. Stemless Barnacles.</p>

<p>A stem barnacle has plates which form a three-cornered
shell. It grows fast to some object by a
small stem which is soft, and can bend about easily.</p>

<p>A stemless barnacle has a shell shaped like an
acorn, or like a rosebud with the top bitten off.
Instead of a stem, it is held fast to the object on
which it grows by a thin plate of shell at its broad,
or flat end. This plate has a tiny hole in the centre.</p>

<p>When you first saw a barnacle, you would not
think it was any relative of Mr. Crab. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
grown up it does not look at all like the Crab
Family. When crabs and barnacles are very
young, they look more like each other.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp96" id="i_125" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_125.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Old and Young Barnacles.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let us look at an acorn barnacle. The shell is
in plates, as if two or three shells were set one over
another. The shell grows by added bits of lime,
as a conch shell does. The thin skin that lines it,
and holds it together, is shed, like Mr. Crab’s coat.
Then the shell has room to grow.</p>

<p>The shell is hard and white. It is lined with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
a very thin skin, which often has a faint, pretty
tint.</p>

<p>The stem barnacles have long, flesh-like stems
which move and sway with the motion of the water.
They look much like a little, queer, pale plum hung
by a thick stem.</p>

<p>The end of the barnacle, which clings to the
stone, log, shell, or fish on which it has fastened
itself, is the head end. The two feelers, which all
these animals have, are turned into two fine tubes,
or pipes. These feelers have little glands or sacs
which make a strong cement. Cement is like glue,
but much more strong and stiff.</p>

<p>This cement fastens Mr. Barnacle to his place.
So after he has settled himself in life, he never
wanders about any more.</p>

<p>Did Mr. Barnacle ever go abroad? Oh, yes!
When he was young he swam about the water-world,
in a very brisk way. Let us hear about that.</p>

<p>Mr. Barnacle makes the same changes of life that
an insect does. First he is an egg, then a larva,
then a pupa, and at last a steady old barnacle. But
the larva barnacle makes two or three changes of
shape before it turns into a pupa.</p>

<p>Barnacles grow fast. They change their coats
often when they are young.</p>

<p>Here is an old acorn barnacle fast upon a stone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
It is about as big as the end of your little finger.
It has some eggs which it packs into the shape of
a small leaf. It tucks this leaf of eggs into a fold
of the thin skin that lines the thick shell.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp66" id="i_127" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_127.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>As the eggs get ready to hatch into larvæ, the
old barnacle is also
growing, and making
more shell. Soon it
is ready to enlarge
the outer shell. So
the inside skin cracks
apart and falls off.
By degrees some barnacles
become quite
large as fresh shell
grows from within.</p>

<p>When the old inside
skin falls off, the
eggs are set free. Out of them come the larvæ.
The larvæ are active, hungry little fellows, who
know how to swim as soon as they are loose in the
water.</p>

<p>The larva acts as if it liked to be free from the
shell prison. It darts about in the sea, and each
day its shape changes. It has one eye, a mouth,
two feelers like horns, and six legs. It can swim,
and can walk over sea-weed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>Some parts of this gay little larva will one day
turn into tubes to make cement to hold it fast to a
stone. Then it will be a stay-at-home barnacle all
the rest of its life long.</p>

<p>When the larva becomes a pupa, it drifts about
until at last it is time for it to stop travelling and
keep still. Then it fixes itself by its head to the
place that will always be its home. All it has to
do after that, is to fish and eat. As it makes new
shell, it will enlarge the old shell. And it will
have little eggs, packed in the shape of a wee leaf
between the skin and outer shell.</p>

<p>By and by Mr. Barnacle has a hard shell of many
plates, his eye has gone down near his stomach.
Do you think he can see what he eats? His legs
are not used for walking, but to fish with; his
mouth is near his feet. The rest of his head has
gone off with his feelers, to attend to making cement
and shell. What a queer creature he is!</p>

<p class="ph3">A FISHING PARTY.</p>


<p>Did you ever go fishing? Did you fish with a
rod and line? Or, did you sit on a pier and let
your line drop into the water from your hand? Or,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
did you go out with the boats and see the men
throw a net into the water?</p>

<p>There are many ways of fishing, and now I shall
tell you of some queer little fishers and their ways.
Why did you want to catch fish? Oh, just for fun!</p>

<p>My little fishers fish for food, and they eat their
fish without any cooking. Their fish are so small
that you cannot see them without the help of a
glass that magnifies.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp24" id="i_130" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_130.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A Fishing Party.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I saw a fishing party to-day. There were twenty
fishers in it. They were all dressed in white coats.
They all sat on one stone.</p>

<p>“What a big stone!” you cry. You had better
say, “Oh, what little fishers!” For, to tell you the
truth, I covered the whole party up with one of my
hands!</p>

<p>Was this a fairy fishing party? No; it was a barnacle
fishing party. I will tell you about it.</p>


<p>The sun shone on the water, the sea was still,
and the tide was slowly going out. It was half-low
tide. A gray rock lay in the water. The water
was yet about two or three inches above the top of
the rock.</p>

<p>On this rock were about twenty stemless barnacles,
clean, white, and acorn-shaped. They were
of the size of small acorns. You must know that
barnacles grow. They are of many sizes. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
are the size of a small
glove-button. Others
are of the size of a small
acorn, or of the end of
your little finger.</p>


<p>As I looked at these
twenty little fishers, the
plates of the shells were
opened a little. Out
of the top of each shell
came a fine little plume,
like five or six tiny
feathers.</p>

<p>This plume waved up
and down in the water.
It seemed to open and
shut gently, as you
would open and shut
your hand.</p>

<p>Every now and then
this little plume was
drawn quite back into
the shell. In a minute
out it came again and
waved as before. What
did all this mean?</p>

<p>It meant that the barnacles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
were having a fishing party. They were
catching their dinner while the tide was over their
shells. Mr. Crab gets his dinner at low tide, and
hides at high tide. Mr. Barnacle fishes and eats at
high tide. At low tide he shuts his shell house and
clings to his place. He is waiting for the tide to
come up and cover him once more.</p>

<p>When Mr. Barnacle opened and shut this fine
plume, it was his net, or his set of lines with which
to fish little live creatures from the water. He
tangles his prey (or food) up in his fine plumes.</p>

<p>Among the things he catches are tiny crabs, too
small for the naked eye to see.</p>

<p>When the plume net is full, he draws it into his
shell. Then he empties it into his mouth. After
this he puts his plume out of his house once more,
to fish for other things. In the meantime, he
feeds on what he has taken. He has no pantry in
which to store things, as Mr. Crab has.</p>

<p>Near this fishing party on the stone, drifted a
log. On the under side of the log were some stem
barnacles. They were fishing too. They fished in
the same way, and for the same kind of things.</p>

<p>They opened their shells, pushed out a lovely
plume, and this pretty thing caught food in its
meshes.</p>

<p>Does their net never break and need to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
mended as the fisherman’s net does? No doubt, if
it does, a new piece will soon grow. What is his
net? It is Mr. Barnacle’s feet. If any of them are
lost or hurt others will come, just as Mrs. Crab gets
new legs when some are gone. Notice these tiny
legs. They look very like a cluster of long fingers
or toes. He uses them to fish with. For what else
should he use them? He never walks nor swims.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_XXXV">LESSON XXXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">A LAST LOOK AT MR. BARNACLE.</p>


<p>It is well to know all you can about barnacles,
for you will see them wherever you go by the seaside.</p>

<p>If you study them, you will not, like the fisherman,
believe foolish things about them, and refuse
to believe true things.</p>

<p>Will it not be pleasant to think of what you
know of their story? When you see an acorn
barnacle fast to a stone, you can think of the days
when he was young and went sailing about. I
wonder if he calls those days “the good old times!”</p>

<p>When you see a stem barnacle swinging in the
water, you can think of what a good time he is
having, fishing with his pretty feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>The stemless barnacles also have, from their
shape, a name which means <i>acorn</i>. You will find
the Latin names easy when you are older and study
more.</p>

<p>The acorn shells can live out of water for a few
hours at a time. When the tide is low, many of
them are left high and dry. But if they should be
out of water too long, they would die for want of
food and water. Perhaps, also, the dry heat of the
air kills them.</p>

<p>If you wish to study them for yourselves, take
home a stone, shell, or stick, with some of them on
it. Put it in a bowl of sea-water. Soon they will
open their shells and begin fishing.</p>

<p>Those barnacles which grow fast to living fish,
sharks, or whales, bury their heads and tubes in the
skins of these animals. I wonder if the whales and
sharks feel them and do not like them.</p>

<p>The barnacles that make the most trouble are
those which fasten upon the outside of ships. The
bottoms of ships are often covered with barnacles.
They make the hull of the ship rough and heavy.
That hinders its motion through the water.</p>

<p>In such a case the ship must be put into a dry
dock. There it is scraped clean. Because of this
trouble and waiting, sailors dislike barnacles. They
often say that they wish there were none.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>In some parts of the world there is a large kind
of barnacles. People eat these as we eat oysters or
mussels.</p>

<p>You need not expect to see the young barnacles
swimming about in the water. They are very tiny
creatures, of the shape of an apple-seed. If you
should see them, I think you would never guess
what they are.</p>

<p>For a great while people thought barnacles were
not worth much study. They called them “shell
fish,” and did not dream what wonders were hidden
in their shell-plate cases. At last, when wise men
knocked at Mr. Barnacle’s house door, and said,
“Come out and tell me your secrets,” they found
he was a most interesting little creature.</p>

<p class="ph3">FLOWERS OF THE SEA.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp19" id="i_135" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_135.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">An Ocean Garden.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are flowers in the sea as well as on the
land. Under the waves of the ocean are fields of
green sea-grasses and groves of great sea-weeds like
trees. Diving-men go down to the sea-bottom and
walk about. They often find it hard to move in
the tall weeds. The weeds tangle the men’s feet.
The divers feel as you would among the brush and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
vines of a great wood. There
are splendid sea-plants of
all colors,—red, pink, white,
green, brown, purple, yellow,
and orange.</p>

<p>The leaves of these sea-plants
are of many shapes.
They are round or long;
they are flat or curly. Some
are cut into fine fingers;
many are like fringes; they
have spots, dots, or knobs
upon them that shine like
silver and gold.</p>

<p>The sea has also another
kind of flowers. These are
animals or fishes that look
more like lovely flowers than
like any other thing. We
call them sea-flowers or animal-flowers.
We name some
of them after dainty little
plants that grow in the woods
in spring.</p>

<p>The name “flowers” which
we give to these is only a
pretty fancy. You must know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
that really they are a kind of animal. It is, then,
flower-animals that we shall now study for a few
lessons.</p>

<p>You have read of animals made upon a ring pattern;
these flower-animals are made upon a star
pattern.</p>

<p>The pattern on which they are made is very simple
(see cut), and yet it is so built
upon and changed that the members
of this Family are among the most
lovely of animals.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp69" id="i_136" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_136.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>These animal-plants have, from
their odd and pretty shapes, such
names as the sunflower, the aster, the fern, the
crown, the fan, the pen, and so on. I will now tell
you about one of them.</p>

<p>Early one day I went from my door to the beach,
which was near, and there I saw a lovely object.</p>

<p>The water was very still and clear, and floating
in it was something all rose and cream color.</p>

<p>This pretty thing was as large as a very large
dinner-plate. It was not flat, but shaped like half
an orange, with the rounded side up. It was of a
fine rose color, and as clear as jelly. It looked
much like pink jelly.</p>

<p>From the centre of the top to the edge went lines
of a deeper pink. There were also dots around the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
outer edge. This edge seemed to have a soft full
ruffle of cream color about it. Looking closer, I
saw that the under side was not flat. It was shaped
like a bell or an open parasol. It had something
which looked like long leaves, and which opened
and shut.</p>

<p>But this was not all that I saw. From the darker
lines on the upper part of the bell ran out long pink
arms. These were almost a yard long. Their
edges had full ruffles. They were of a cream color,
like soft lace.</p>

<p>These long arms hung down in the water, which
spread out their pretty edges. With a soft and
gentle motion they waved from side to side.</p>

<p>In my boat I went quietly near this creature. It
floated here and there, spread out in all its beauty.
I kept near it to watch it. This lovely thing was a
jelly-fish.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_137" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_137.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span style="margin-left: 0em;">Fig. 1.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">Fig. 2.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Fig. 3.</span></figcaption>
</figure>


<p>It was easy to see that the creature was of a star
pattern, but it had four, and not five rays. Its plan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
was like Figure 1. If these rays are bent down,
you will see that they may form the frame of a bell-shape,
like Figure 2. The ends of these four rays
often run out into arms, like Figure 3. All the
soft pink-and-cream jelly-like stuff fills up between
the upper part of the rays and gathers into the
ruffles along the edge.</p>

<p>This is the plan on which the jelly-fish is built.
His frame is built of four rays. The four parts
between the rays may be again divided and be
eight and not four. Again, there may be sixteen
rays instead of eight. But the plan is the same.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_XXXVII">LESSON XXXVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE LIFE OF A JELLY-FISH.</p>


<p>It is from the clear stuff between the rays, the
stuff which forms the bell or disk part, that the
jelly-fish has its common name.</p>

<p>It has also another name, which means <i>nettle</i>,
from the plant called a nettle. The leaves of this
plant can prick and sting your skin, and make it
burn. The fine, long arms of the jelly-fish can
sting in the same way.</p>

<p>The jelly-fish is nearly all water. It is made of
flesh as fluid as the white of an egg. If taken from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
the water, jelly-fish die in a very short time. They
die by drying up. A very large jelly-fish will dry
to a thin, small skin.</p>

<p>I do not know of any other living creature so soft,
or so nearly all water, as a jelly-fish. And yet these
are true animals. They can hear, see, feel, and, no
doubt, can also taste as other animals do.</p>

<p>All along the edge of the bell part you can see
some dark dots, which are the eyes. Some of the
jelly-fish have these little eyes bare; that is, they
have no lid or cover over them. These are called
bare-eyed jelly-fish. Others have a little hood like
a lid over each eye. Also along the bell part are
little sacs which take the place of ears. The long
arms which droop from the edge of the bell are the
feelers. These are used to touch things with. They
wave gently to and fro and help the fish to move
through the water.</p>

<p>Up in the centre of the under side of the bell is
the mouth. It has over it a little fine frill. Even
a jelly-fish, you see, does not wish to keep its mouth
wide open all the time!</p>

<p>Below the mouth, the jelly-fish has fishing-lines
or nets, as the barnacle has. The soft, pretty ruffles
move up and down in the water, and catch things
to put into the mouth of the jelly-fish.</p>

<p>It would surprise you to know what large and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
hard things these soft
jelly-fish can soften
and use as food. Fish,
crabs, shell-fish, are
caught and eaten by
jelly-fish.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp27" id="i_140_2" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_140.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">The Jelly-fish.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is something
in the jelly-fish which
can dissolve these
hard things. He often
casts out from his
mouth-sac the harder
and larger shells and
bones. He does this
as you would put
from your mouth nutshells
or plum-stones.</p>



<p>How do the jelly-fish
move in the
water? They have
no swimming-feet as
Mr. Crab has. They
have no fins, as the
fish has. Some of
them move by spreading
out the bell, or
round part, of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
bodies, and then drawing it up again. This
motion, which is like the rise and fall of your
chest when you breathe, drives them through
the water.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp26" id="i_143" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_143.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Flowers of the Sea.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Other jelly-fish have a motion more like the opening
and closing of the hands. Some have little oars,
paddles, or hairs on the edge of the disk. Some
seem to open and close as you would slowly open
and shut an umbrella.</p>

<p>The swimming-bell of the jelly-fish is often called
the umbrella from its shape. This bell has little
fine muscles through it, by which it can spread
out and draw together. You know you have muscles
by which you can move the parts of your
body.</p>

<p>On the under side of the swimming-bell, is a flap
called the veil. This flap turns inward, and the
little fine muscles spread over it. This veil is
pulled together in the act of swimming, and pushes
out the water from the bell. Then the bell spreads
and takes in more water, and again it is driven out.
A boy in swimming parts and pushes the water
back with his arms, the jelly-fish has no arms or
legs, but still it moves about easily.</p>

<p>I told you that jelly-fish could sting. They can
also shine. They can make a fine bright light,
something as glow-worms or fire-flies do, but more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
steady. From this power, they have been called
Lamps of the Sea. I have seen the ocean bright
with them for miles. It looked as if all the stars
had fallen from the sky, and were glowing in the
water.</p>


<p>When the jelly-fish shine so, the light is like a
ball. It is not in straight lines, long, or square. It
is round, like fire-balls, or balls of melted iron, or of
glass. These balls are sometimes red, or blue, or
white, or green, or yellow.</p>

<p>Jelly-fish differ much in size. Some are so small
that you can hardly see them; some are as large as
a split pea. Then some are the size of a dime, of a
dollar, of a plate, and so on, up to the size of a huge
wheel.</p>

<p>As they are of many sizes, so they are of many
shapes, as I told you at first. They are like
balls, fans, bells, bottles, plumes, baskets, cups,
flowers.</p>

<p>And now, here is another odd thing to tell you.
You know that when Mr. Barnacle is young he
swims about. When he is grown up, he settles
down to stay in one place. The jelly-fish stays in
one place, and grows fast, when he is young, but
when he has grown up he swims about wherever
he chooses. I wonder which is the better way!
Which way would you children like best?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>Some of the jelly-fishes
come from an
egg. Some of them
come from what is
called a bud. Let us
look at them from the
bud or from the egg.
The egg at once fastens
to some solid thing
on the sea-bottom. It
grows into what looks
like a plant with stems
and branches.</p>

<p>On these branches
are little cup-shaped
buds. These buds are
so many little jelly-fish
growing on one
stem. This is the
larva state. After a
time, these buds open,
and a young jelly-fish
breaks from the slender
stem, and at once
goes swimming away,
as happy as a jelly-fish
knows how to be.</p>

<p class="ph3">SEA-STARS.</p>


<p>Now we come to another animal who seems to be
made on the star plan. Here you see pictures of
him in the water, where he has his home. Is he
not a pretty thing?</p>

<p>The jelly-fish has one of his names from his shape,
and another name from his power to sting. This
fish gets one name from his shape,—star-fish.
And he has a long, hard name from his coat. His
coat is a thick, tough skin. It has upon it prickles
much like those of a hedge-hog. Most of them
have five rays, or ten, because each single ray has
been made into two, and so on.</p>

<p>All of the star-fish do not keep to the plan of five.
The sun-star has twelve rays. He is of a splendid,
bright-red color. These animals seem to be made
on the star plan; the grown-up sea-stars show this
shape most clearly, but it is never perfect; the
young ones are two-sided, not star-like.</p>

<p>From their general shape they are called “stars,”
from their skins, “rough or hedge-hog coated.”
This skin is really their skeleton: they have their
bones outside like the crabs and some other creatures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<figure class="figleft illowp28" id="i_145" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_145.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">The Ray Family at Home.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The crab’s skeleton
is hard, the sea-star’s
is more like a
tough skin filled with
little plates or spikes
of shelly stuff. Sometimes
these little
plates lock together,
sometimes they
merely lie near each
other, so some of
the stars have much
softer coats than the
others. In the water
these coats are tough
and bend like leather.
When they are dry
they are brittle. If
you want a dead star-fish
to bend, drop it
into water.</p>

<p>I will tell you of
some kinds of star-fish,
and then will tell
you how they grow.</p>

<p>In the picture you
see a star-fish with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
the thin, crooked rays, or arms. He is called a
sand-star, because he likes to lie close to the sand
on the sea-bottom. He is of a sand color.</p>

<p>The one with the curled arms, like plumes, is
called the brittle-star. That is because he breaks
so easily. He is a very queer fellow. When things
do not please him, he drops all to pieces. It would
be a queer thing, if, when you feel cross or afraid,
you could throw yourself down and fly to pieces,
jerking off your head, your arms, and your legs!</p>

<p>You have heard how crabs can drop off a claw,
and then another grows out. You also know that
a spider does not mind much about losing a leg or
two. These facts cause us to feel sure that these
creatures do not suffer pain at the loss of a part
of their bodies. If the loss of legs, claws, or rays
caused pain, these animals would not be so ready to
drop them.</p>

<p>There is no other creature that breaks itself so
readily and so entirely as the brittle-star. It will
throw off all its rays, and they will float away in
many directions, while the little disk is left alone to
sink or to float.</p>

<p>When the star-fish loses one or more, or even
four rays, others will soon grow. All the animals
of this family renew lost parts even more easily than
crabs do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>It is very hard to get a brittle-star out of the
water. As soon as it feels a net or scoop or the
upper air about it, or a pail of fresh water rising
gently around it, it breaks into many pieces.</p>

<p>On the end of every ray is a little sharp eye.
When you frighten Mr. Brittle-Star, off swim his
legs, every one by itself, and each has its one eye to
look out for it. I never saw anything else so queer;
did you?</p>

<p>The strong, prim-looking star-fish, with five points,
is called the cross-star. It is the common, or pattern
star-fish. There are many other kinds. I will tell
you in the next lesson of one very pretty kind. You
must go to larger books to learn all that is known
about these strange and lovely creatures.</p>

<p>We will look at the model, or cross-star. Turn
the animal over. The mouth is in the centre of the
under side. Do you not find there is a seam, or
groove of the hard skin, all the way down the centre
of each ray? From the mouth a nerve runs down
to the point of each of the rays.</p>

<p>Along the centres of the under openings in the
rays are set very, very many little blunt points.
These points are like tiny tubes close together.
It is on these that the star-fish can walk or creep
on the bottom of the sea, or over rocks. The
star-fish seek their food as they crawl slowly about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>Star-fish are very greedy. They are always hungry.
They make the fishermen much trouble by
eating the fish-bait off their hooks. They also
devour oysters. When they get into an oyster-bed
they are as bad as the drill. When an army of star-fish
go to a part of the coast where oysters grow,
the oysters are soon killed.</p>

<p>The star-fish are of many bright and pretty colors.
They are green, brown, gray, red, pink, or with
several colors on the same star.</p>

<p>When they are dead, the flesh, which has much
water in it, dries away. The tough shell-like skin
is left. You can dry them by pinning them on a
board. Leave them for a few days in the sun and
wind. If you do not pin out the rays, they may
curl up.</p>

<p>They look better kept in alcohol, but that is not
a good way for children. I fear the bottles would
soon be broken.</p>

<p class="ph3">A SEA-CHANGE.</p>


<p>The star-fish lay a great number of eggs. Let
us see what happens to eggs of one kind. They
are not dropped one by one into the water, or strung
on threads like chains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<figure class="figright illowp27" id="i_150" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_150.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Water Babies.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>They stick to the under-side of the parent fish,
which settles on the sand or rocks, resting on its
back, and bends up its five rays, like a basket, to
hold and protect the eggs.</p>


<p>You see that in this state the parent can neither
walk nor eat. And although star-fish are both
greedy and restless, when they have eggs to take
care of, they patiently lie quiet for ten days, until
the eggs hatch.</p>

<p>In those ten days the parent star-fish cannot eat
nor move. But at the end of ten days, the eggs
hatch out the larvæ, and they float away. Then
the star-fish finds that its work is done, and it
bends back and begins to walk, swim, and fish.</p>

<p>Many of the larvæ, when they first come from
the egg, have no rays, and do not look one bit like
star-fish. They look like wee specks of barrels, with
little hairy hoops, and a plume of hairs on one end.</p>

<p>The larva can swim; the hairs help it through
the water. Slowly it begins to change its shape
and to lose its loop of hairs. All it wants is to
swim and to grow. When no larger than a flaxseed
it looks like the grown-up star-fish.</p>

<p>A most curious thing is the lily-star egg, which
fastens upon a coral, or something firm and hard.
Then it takes as fast hold as the barnacle on the rock.</p>

<p>It shoots up a stem, and on the top of the stem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
grows a cup like a
lily-bell. It does not
look like a star-fish,
but like a lovely lily.
Fine plumes are waving
from its cup.</p>

<p>Some kinds of
star-fish have larvæ
that take other
shapes. I cannot
tell you about them
all. But only the
feather-star grows
fast to some object
for the larval state.
In that state they
do not look at all
like the parent. Finally,
like the jelly-fish,
they change
their shape, get
loose, and swim off
to see the water-world.
Then they
are like their parents.</p>


<p>Now let us look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
again at our star-fish. The little things like tubes
on the under-side are each one set in a grove.
They are full of fluid, and each has a tiny sucker.
The star-fish can move them. They not only serve
for feet, but for hands, to catch, and hold, and kill
his prey.</p>

<p>Most of the star-fish are dull and slow of motion.
There is one kind which moves quickly. It is
called the Snake’s-tail-Star, from the shape of the
rays, which are long and thin.</p>

<p>There is one of these animals often found on the
coast of the Southern states, which has all the
space between the rays filled up with a hard, stony,
or shell-like matter. So the shape of this animal is
not like a star. It is like a flat box with five sides.
There are some little loop-holes quite through this
hard box. On the middle of the top is the pattern
of a five-pointed star-fish, like a picture! It is not
a star-fish, but an urchin.</p>

<p>In this Radiate, the disk spreads out, so as to
include, or shut in, the rays. On the one hand,
there are some star-fish that have the disk very
small. They seem to be all rays and no disk.</p>

<p>People who have studied star-fish divide them
into six families. I have told you about all but the
fifth. The fifth family are of such a queer shape
that they are called cucumbers—Sea-Cucumbers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
The Chinese like to eat them, and ships are sent
out to fish for them. They grow in the shallows,
near the islands in tropic seas. We have some also
on our coasts.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE STAR-FISH WITH AN OVERCOAT.</p>


<p>There is a very pretty star-fish called the Sea-Egg,
or Sea-Urchin. This creature has not five
points or rays; it is in the shape of a ball, somewhat
flattened.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_152" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_152.jpg" alt="">
   <figcaption class="caption"><span style="margin-left: 0em;">Fig. 1.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">Fig. 2.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Fig. 3.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Do you say, “Can this belong to the Star-fish
Family, when it has no rays?” Well, let us see.
Let Figure 1 represent our Ray pattern. Bend
the rays up, and the plan looks like Figure 2.
Then bend them until the tips touch, and you have
the form of Figure 3. The cover of this star-fish,
called the sea-urchin, is not tough and skin-like; it
is hard and shell-like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>If you look at it, you will see that it has up and
down it lines of knobs and dots set in double rows.
You will find five double lines of large knobs, and
as many lines of small dots between the larger ones.</p>

<p>Do not think that you can see these marks as
soon as you find a sea-urchin. By no means! The
sea-urchin wears a fine thick overcoat, which hides
his shell.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_153" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_153.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Well Dressed.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I knew a boy who found a number of sea-eggs
lying on the beach. He cried out, “Oh! look at
all the chestnut burrs in the water!” The sea-egg
when it is alive looks much like a chestnut burr,
ripe, but not open. It is covered all over with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
thorns or prickles like the burr, and the water gives
it the dark brown color.</p>

<p>Now let us look into this matter. You have read
that a cross-star-fish has along the under edges of
its rays many little tubes full of something like
water. He can move them, and upon them he walks.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_154" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_154.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Undressed.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The sea-urchin has hard, sharp spines, which
cover all the shell, and look like a rough coat. In
the pictures you see the urchin with his shell bare,
with his shell half bare, and with his full overcoat
of quills. When the shell is bare, you will see upon
it little lines of points or knobs. These are very
pretty, but they are for use, rather than for beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>On every tiny knob is placed a spine, and the
urchin can turn and move his spines, in all directions,
just as easily as you can move your arm at
the shoulder-joint.</p>

<p>When the urchin is alive, the quills stand out
all about him. After he is dead, the quills drop
off.</p>

<p>Between the rows of knobs are five double rows
of holes, like pin-pricks. Out of these grow such
little suckers as I told you the star-fish had.</p>

<p>In some countries the sea-urchins are small—not
much larger than a dime. In warmer seas the
urchins grow large, even as large as a large orange.
People often use these larger ones for food.</p>

<p>The sea-urchin walks on his spines, as the cross-star-fish
does on his. But as the quills of the
urchin are all around him, like a ball-cover, his
walk is a roll! By the little suckers he can
cling to the rocks, and he can climb up their
sides.</p>

<p>Turn over the bare urchin shell, and you will see
that while at the top it has no opening larger than
a pin-prick, on the under side there is a hole where
the curved rays do not come entirely together.
You see the urchin must have this open place for
his fish-lines, and to put food into his ever-hungry
mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>Since the sea-urchin eats so much, he must grow!
Does he?</p>

<p>Yes, the sea-urchin grows, and it cannot cast its
shell as a crab can. It has not a soft skin as you
have, yet his shell is never too tight. How can the
shell expand as the urchin grows?</p>

<p>The shell is made up of a great many little plates,
or scales. As the urchin within grows and needs
more room, these little scale-plates grow larger all
around.</p>

<p>Here is a strange thing: these wee plates are
set like bricks in a dome. You know the urchin is
made on the five-ray pattern bent like a flattened
ball.</p>

<p>About the body of the urchin, within the shell, is
wrapped a soft, pretty, silk-like mantle. This mantle
lines the shell. It takes lime from the sea-water
and builds it into more shell along the five edges of
these wee plates. It also adds new plates.</p>

<p>So, as the urchin keeps growing all the time, its
mantle is building upon the plates all the time.
The house or coat, whichever you choose to call
it, grows with the growth of its owner. I think
your mother would be glad if she could find you a
coat to grow with the growth of your body.</p>

<p>The shell part of the urchin is gray or greenish
gray. The quills are often red, brown, pink, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
purple. When a number of these urchins are fast
upon a rock, they look like a bed of lovely fringed
flowers.</p>

<p>The urchins are able to bore holes even in the
hard limestone rock. They bore these holes to live
in, and, as they grow, they make the holes larger,
but not the openings. So, after a time, they are
shut into a prison which they have dug for themselves.
They do not do this on our coast.</p>

<p>On the coast of Spain you will find the rocks
covered with these urchins, fixed in holes. No
doubt they feel that stone walls are safe walls.
If they had wished to get away, and go and come
freely, I think they could have made their doorways
as large as themselves.</p>

<p>There is much more to be learned about sea-urchins.
You will do well to study them when you
can. In fact, the longest life is not long enough
in which to learn even what is to be learned of very
simple and common things. There is danger that
when we have learned a little we shall become
proud, and that we shall not take the trouble to
learn the very much more which we do not know.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE FLYING FLOWERS.</p>


<p>You have just read about some of the Radiate
Family. From their beauty they have been called
Flowers of the Sea. We will now hear about some
insects which might be called Flying Flowers.</p>

<p>I knew a little boy who, the first time that he
noticed butterflies, cried out, “Oh, see all those
flowers flying!” That was a pretty idea. It well
described the butterflies, as you will see when you
come to read about them.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>There is another family of insects which also
deserves the name of Flying Flowers. Their shape,
colors, and motions are very lovely. These insects
are the Dragon-Flies.</p>

<p>I am sorry that such beautiful creatures have
had harsh names given to them. They are called
Dragon-Flies, Horse-Stingers, Darning-Needles,
Spindles, and so on. These names have nothing
true in them. These pretty insects never harm
any one.</p>

<p>The French people call them Little Ladies.
Now, that is a nicer name. It is given to them
because they are graceful and pretty, and also neat
and delicate, in their looks and motions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<figure class="figleft illowp27" id="i_159" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_159.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A Flight of Dragon-flies.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>I knew a man who
called these insects
Air-Jewels. That was
because they are almost
always on the
wing, and their eyes
and bodies flash and
shine like precious
gems.</p>

<p>I have known silly
people to start and
scream when one of
these dragon-flies
came darting by. That
was foolish; they
might as well scream
at a rose or a violet.
There is no need of
running away from
one of them. The
great trouble is that
they are so swift and
shy, you cannot
easily catch one if you
wish to examine it.</p>

<p>The dragon-flies
are cousins of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
termites, the may-flies, and the lace-wing flies.
They have four large, fine, lace-like wings, divided
into a great many spaces or meshes.</p>

<p>The two pairs of wings are nearly or quite equal
in size. The head is large. The body is long
and light. They are very active in their motions,
and are very seldom at rest. They fly so swiftly
that you can scarcely see their thin wings, but
only the flash of their bright-colored bodies.</p>

<p>Dragon-flies like damp or wet places. You will
find them above lakes and ponds. They fly over
marshy places or by the edges of quiet streams.</p>

<p>Go out to some still, silver-like pond, where the
tall trees stand in a ring about the water. The
ferns, the tall yellow spikes of the St. John’s-wort,
and the blue clubs of the arrow-plant make a wreath
around the sandy margin. There you will see
hundreds of gay dragon-flies darting up and down.
They swing in the sunbeams, as if glad to be alive.</p>

<p>In their great beauty the dragon-flies are as
pretty as the butterflies. Like them, they love
the sunshine. They are the children of the summer
time. The hotter the weather, the happier the
dragon-flies seem to be.</p>

<p>Let us look for a little time at a dragon-fly. It
belongs to the class of the ring-made creatures. Its
body is made in rings, and its feet and legs are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
jointed. The body is very long and slim. Some
kinds of dragon-flies have the body rather flat, but
usually it is round, is slimmest in the middle, and
thickens a little both at the tail and where it joins
the breast.</p>

<p>The wings of the dragon-fly are horny and of
iris or golden hues. Sometimes the body is a vivid
blue or bright green. Sometimes it is banded or
spotted with yellow or scarlet.</p>

<p>The wide wings look like delicate lace spread on
a fine frame. A little child who found one of these
wings, brought it to me, saying, “I dot a dood piece
of lace!”</p>

<p>The head of the dragon-fly is large, and has on
each side what you would call a great eye. But like
that of the house-fly, this eye is made up of many
eyes set so as to seem to be one. I hardly dare
tell you how many there are—over twelve thousand!
Through these wonderful eyes the light
plays and flashes like fire. Between these big eyes
three little simple eyes are set in a band across the
head.</p>

<p>The dragon-fly has a queer mouth. The jaws are
hidden under two thin, skin-like lips. These move
up and down as it eats. It does not suck food, like
the butterflies and house-flies, but eats after the
manner of the beetle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>Thus, you see, the dragon-fly belongs to the great
Division of the Eaters, not of the Drinkers. Instead
of feeding on nectar, as we would think so lovely a
thing should, it eats insects.</p>

<p>All its life long, from the egg, it is always greedy,
because it is always hungry. It spends all its time
hunting for food. Who could count how many
small insects a dragon-fly, eats in his short lifetime?</p>

<p class="ph3">UNDER THE WATER.</p>


<p>Now let us hear the story of the dragon-fly from
its beginning. While it is an egg, a larva, and a
pupa, it lives under the water. Only when about
to burst from the pupa-case, and at last get its
wings, does it leave the water and seek the upper
air.</p>

<p>In all its early stages the dragon-fly lives in cool,
still shallows, among green and graceful water-plants.
There the sunshine glows all about it, as
it darts over the bottom of the pond, hunting for
food.</p>

<p>The mother dragon-fly, as she flits over the
water, drops her eggs upon it. They sink to the
bottom. She may put them into plant stems.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
Their cases are waterproof.
If the eggs are
not eaten up by beetles
and other fellow-citizens
under water, they are
quite safe, and soon the
larvæ hatch out.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp24" id="i_163" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_163.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Home of the Dragon-fly.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Most insects move
quickly in the larva state,
and are dull or quite
asleep in the pupa-case.
This is not the way
with the dragon-fly. He
is busy and strong all
his life. The egg settled
upon the pond bottom
is quiet; the larva moves
about, but is rather slow
and lazy. The pupa
dashes here and there,
and frightens all the
little animals in the
pond. At last the perfect
insect rises on the
wing. It darts about
with almost the swiftness
of light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>The larva of the dragon-fly is gray. It has six
legs. It is always hungry, and feeds on small
water-animals, as beetles, grubs, shrimps, leeches,
and their young.</p>

<p>This larva does not run after its food, but lies
waiting for it. On the bottom of the pond, hidden
in the shadow of a leaf, root, or stone, or seated on
stems or leaves that are under water, the larva waits
patiently for its prey to come by.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a person with a net for catching
insects? This net is a fine bag set on a little hoop.
The hoop is fastened upon a long handle. Sometimes
the handle has joints, and will fold up. As
insects dart by, the person with the net brings it
down over them with a quick motion.</p>

<p>The dragon-fly larva has something much like
this with which to catch its food. The lower jaw
is fastened by a hinge to a little jointed rod. The
rod, and the jaw-plate upon the end of it, when not
in use, are folded down upon the head of the insect.</p>

<p>The plate has fine teeth upon its edge. When
the prey comes by, the larva snaps out its rod, with
the plate, as if they both were on a spring, and so
catches the things that are swimming along a little
way off. They do not see their foe, and do not
know that he can reach so far with his sweep net.</p>

<p>The teeth on the edge of the plate shut up, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
then the rod folds back, and puts the food into the
hungry larva’s throat. I suppose the little creatures
that swim along feel quite happy and safe, and then,
all at once, out springs this weapon, and they are
gone.</p>

<p>But this little plague of the pond is not quite
safe himself. There are some other creatures down
under the water that eat him. All nature is a kind
of game of “tit for tat,” you see.</p>

<p>The larva of the dragon-fly breathes air. He has
no lungs as you have, but gills as a fish has. How
does he get air?</p>

<p>Through his body goes a long tube. The tube
ends in a horny point at the tail. This point is
made of five very fine spikes. These spikes and
this tube are able to take from the water some of
the air that is in it. Thus he gets air much as a
fish does.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>This spike on the tail of the larva has a very
strange use. It shoots out the water which it has
taken in, as you would shoot water from a squirt-gun.
It shoots the water out with such power that it drives
the larva along in the water.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a steamboat driven through the
water by a screw or wheel at the stern, or hind
part? What do you think that the man who first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
made such a boat said? He said that he took his
idea of how it should be made by seeing this queer
larva move in the water.</p>

<p>When this creature seizes food, he likes to strike
it from below. He rises under it in the stroke, as
the shark does. Dragon-fly larvæ are very bold.
They can eat large and hard insects.</p>

<p>When the larva changes to a pupa, it becomes
more lively, fierce, and hungry than ever. It does
not change its form at this time as much as most
insects do.</p>

<p>The dragon-fly pupa has six legs, and each foot
has strong hooks on it. Its color is pale brown,
clear and shining, and its case is horny. Some
rings of the body have horny spikes upon them.
Upon the case of the chest is a pattern like
wings.</p>

<p>These pupæ dash about the bottom of the pond,
swimming or running, and eat almost everything
that lives there. The body and head of the pupa
are thicker than those of the grown-up dragon-fly.
They are made for seizing and killing prey.</p>

<p>When it is nearly time for the pupa to come out
as a dragon-fly, the case grows clearer, like glass.
The large, beautiful eyes grow brighter and brighter,
and the pupa leaves the deeper part and gets near
the edge of the pond.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_168.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>When the close of the pupa state draws near, the
coming dragon-fly loses its fierce appetite. It seems
to feel tired and heavy. It breathes slowly, as if it
could not get air enough. The body has changed
inside the horny case, and the time is near when it
will leave the water for air, and walking for flying.</p>

<p>Once the larva wanted nothing better than to
chase bugs about under water. Now, all at once,
it longs for the free air and for the sun. It needs
no one to tell it what to do. In some way it knows
exactly how it should act.</p>

<p>This tired pupa now seeks the stem of some tall
reed or grass that grows in the water. Slowly it
crawls up the stem. The hooks on the feet take
fast hold as it goes, and it keeps on until it is nearly
a yard above water.</p>

<p>The hooks, though very small, are so sharp and
hard that they can go into wood. When the pupa
is as high up as he wants to be he drives the hooks
into the stem. Thus it will hold firm even when it
twists and struggles hard.</p>

<p>The pupa likes best to find two reeds or stems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
near, so that it can take hold of both and swing
between the two. Then, like a child in a swing, it
begins to sway to and
fro. Now, as it sways,
a strange thing happens.
The hard pupa-case
splits open upon
the back, and look,
inside the case, we
see the perfect insect,
with its wings!</p>

<p>The pupa-case is
firmly held by its
hooked feet, while the
new insect twists and
pulls, and so gets
free; and little by
little its head, legs,
wings, and long body
come forth, and finally
hang only by the last
ring of the body.</p>

<p>Then you would
think it was dead. For after it stretches out first
one leg and then the other, it hangs by its last ring,
stiff and still. But it is only resting. After about
fifteen minutes it awakes. Taking hold firm with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
its feet upon a stem or leaf, it lets go its hold upon
the pupa-case. That is left hanging by its hooks in
its place.</p>

<p>Here is now a dragon-fly, with large head, with
two great cluster eyes, six legs, four wings, and
long, bright-hued body! And now, at last, it can
breathe freely
through all
those tubes and
air-holes you
have been told
about.</p>

<p>Still the insect
does not
look like the
full-made dragon-fly.
The colors are dull, and the wings are
folded up. The body is soft, damp, and too short.
The big eyes are dim.</p>

<p>As if half asleep it still clings to the stem, not far
from the case, which is the old shape of itself.
Hanging to the reeds by the pond you will often
find these old coffins, if you look for them.</p>

<p>The new insect is drawing in the sunshine and
fresh air. It stands still and breathes hard, filling
its new body with pure, dry air. Now and then its
wings quiver.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp98" id="i_169" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_169.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>As they quiver they spread out, fold after fold, as
silken banners wave out upon the air. Then at
last they are spread out wide, in all their beauty.
The dragon-fly has reached its last and highest
state. It can sail away where it pleases on its new
wings.</p>

<p>As the wings grow larger, the eyes of the dragon-fly
grow brave and bright; its body dries. Then
it gleams like a jewel. Its fresh colors come out
clearly. It feels strong and active.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, it uses its new wings. It rises
into the air and flashes here and there, just as
hungry and ten times swifter than ever before.</p>

<p>The flight of the dragon-fly is called hawking, for
it is like the motion of that strong bird, the hawk.
If it gets caught in a place where its wide wings
cannot turn, it can fly backwards and get off safely.
In a place where the wings might be injured by
striking against leaves or branches, it flies out in
this way.</p>

<p>When dragon-flies are dead, the great beauty of
their bodies passes away. They fade and grow
dull, as when they first came from the pupa-case.
The scarlet, yellow, blue, or green turns to a dull
drab. So you cannot keep them as well as you can
keep beetles. It is life that gives the dragon-fly its
splendid beauty.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE DRAGON-FLY AND HIS COUSINS.</p>


<p>The dragon-fly eats almost every kind of insects
which you have thus far read about. Beetles, spiders,
flies, centipedes, fresh-water shrimps, and polliwogs
are its food.</p>

<p>The dragon-fly is a larva for a year. It is a perfect
dragon-fly only a part of one summer. You
will find the most dragon-flies in July or August.
When the frost comes, they die.</p>

<p>Dragon-flies are very strong; they are fond of
chasing other insects. They seem to catch and
tear them for the mere pleasure of pulling them to
pieces. They also fight with each other, and Mr.
and Mrs. Dragon-fly have some hard battles.</p>

<p>The dragon-fly does not have a long lip, or mask,
set on a rod, as the larva had. They fly so swiftly
that they do not need such help in getting food.</p>

<p>Few insects are so easy on the wing as this, and
few have such beauty of wing. Yet I think, after
all, that the chief beauty of the dragon-fly is in its
eyes. These are like two great flaming jewels.</p>

<p>The eyes are beautiful, for this clear, glowing
light in them; the body, for vivid color; the wings,
for their lace-like texture. Each of the wings has a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
dark spot on the front edge. Often, in flying, this
spot and the line of bright color of the body, almost
like a streak of fire, are all that can be seen of the
insect.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_172_2" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_172.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">The Dragon-fly and his Cousins.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are several kinds of dragon-flies. These
are different in color and size, and in the shape
of their bodies. One, with a very long, thin, dark
body, is called the Darning-Needle. One, with a
thicker body, is called the Ringed-Club. Its body
is largest at the tail end. This one is dressed in
black and gold, and is large and strong.</p>

<p>A smaller kind of dragon-fly, which has no spots
on the wings, is called the Little Lady. This is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
among the prettiest of all; some of them are bright
red; some a clear light blue. They look more like
creatures in some dream about fairies, than like real
live insects, for they flit here and there like streaks
of gay-colored light, and you can scarcely see the
wings on which they fly.</p>

<p>The dragon-fly has some very handsome relations.
One of these is called the Lace-Wing. The
head and body of the lace-wing are bright green,
its wings are like white gauze; but its chief beauty
is in its eyes. Some call it the Golden-Eye, because
its eyes are like a drop of amber, or melted gold.</p>

<p>The veins in the wings of the lace-wing are very
fine. As the light falls on them, they change in color,
and look like pink, red, blue, green, or gold threads.</p>

<p>These lovely lace-wings do not like the bright
light of the noon-day, as the dragon-fly does.
They prefer to come out in the moonlight, or when
the sun is setting.</p>

<p>The lace-wing is not a water lover, as the dragon-fly
is. It lays its eggs on leaves, and every egg is
held upon a little silken stem. The stem is much
like the silk which the spider spins. These eggs
are laid in groups.</p>

<p>When the young lace-wings come out of the
eggs, they feed on the little aphis. You remember
the aphis makes the honey that ants are so fond of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>In two weeks these larvæ change to pupæ. To
do this the lace-wing larva spins a nice silk ball, in
which it goes to bed for a nap while it is a pupa.</p>

<p>In this, you see, it is not at all like the young
dragon-fly, which hunts and runs about while it is a
pupa. The ball of the sleeping lace-wing is about
the size and shape of a wild pea, or vetch seed.</p>

<p>The lace-wings are short lived. One summer
makes a lifetime for them. In a summer they
grow from infancy to age, make all their changes,
and live out their time as complete insects.</p>

<p>When the lace-wing is dead, it loses all its fine
colors in a very few hours.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_XLV">LESSON XLV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE WINGS OF THE DRAGON-FLY.</p>


<p>We can find no better example than the dragon-fly,
of the way in which insects behave when they
leave the pupa-case.</p>

<p>You know that this case is horny or tough, and
always seems smaller than the grown-up insect; so
the insect must be very closely packed in.</p>

<p>No person could pack a new insect back into the
case it has just left.</p>

<p>While the dragon-fly pupa is under water, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
case is kept tough, and yet soft enough to bend.
But when the pupa crawls up the stem of the plant
into the air, the case soon dries and becomes brittle.</p>

<p>As the fly struggles within, the dry case will
easily split. The little wet coat, which covers the
body while it is in the case, makes it more easy to
slip out of the shell when it cracks open. You
know if you have on your finger a ring which is too
tight, you can pull it off if you wet your finger.</p>

<p>The wet coat of the fly in the case keeps the
wings from being hurt by their close folding. After
they are dry and spread out, they are easy to break.
Then it is very easy to hurt or spoil them.</p>

<p>The fly seems to know this, and is careful of its
wings. In the act of unfolding, the fly holds its
wings from touching any object, even its own body.</p>

<p>When the dragon-fly gets free from the case, it
knows just how to spread its lovely wings into
perfect shape. It stands quite still, and far enough
from stems or leaves to keep its wide wings safe.</p>

<p>It does not move its wings, but lets the air do
the work, while it holds its bent body away from
the wings. The quiver you see through it, now
and then, is a motion of the body; and I will soon
tell you what it means.</p>

<p>When the fly first comes from the case, its wings
are soft, and will bend as easily as wet paper.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
After they are dry, they are like thin plates of
glass. These wings have very many nerves through
them. Their frame is like a fine net-work, and, as
it is touched by the air, it spreads slowly to its full
size. If, at this drying-time, the wings are hurt,
they will never come to their right shape.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_176_2" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_176.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>If any one should try to help a dragon-fly out of
its case its wings would be ruined and never take
their right shape. Human hands are too clumsy
for such work.</p>

<p>When first the pupa comes from the case, the
wings and body are of a dull, faded color. But as
it stands in the sun and air, you can see it change
from minute to minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<figure class="figleft illowp27" id="i_179_2" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_179.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A Child of an Hour.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Fold after fold of the wings shakes out; ring
after ring of the body stretches to its proper length;
the joints of the legs come to their right shape and
firmness. From all the body of the insect a mist
seems to pass away; and the colors of the fly come
out, and red, blue, green, gold, shine in beauty.</p>

<p>Now let us look closely at these fine wide wings.
Although they are so thin, like gauze, yet they are
double. There is a surface on each side, spread
over a very fine frame. The parts of this frame are
small as the finest hairs.</p>

<p>And yet, though so tiny, they are all hollow.
They are tubes or pipes. They carry through the
wing, air and a very thin white fluid, which is the
blood of the insect.</p>

<p>Now that you know this, can you clearly see how
the wings expand? As soon as the dragon-fly is
born from its pupa-case, air and this thin fluid are
driven through these fine tubes. As they fill, they
stretch out, and the thin surface which covers them
spreads with them.</p>

<p>If you notice the fly as it is thus getting its shape,
you will see that quiver which I spoke of. That
motion is the pumping of air and fluid through its
tubes; and, no doubt, by this action the fly spreads
out its wings and its body. By such a motion the
blow-fly spreads out its big head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>The dragon-fly spends about fifteen minutes in
getting into shape. Sometimes half an hour is
needed. After that, the fly rests for an hour or
two, before it tries its wings in the air. Very likely
it wishes to give its wings time to get quite firm
and hard.</p>

<p>Butterflies, Lace-Wings, May-Flies, and other insects
of the kind have their wings made in this
way; so what you learn about one will help you to
understand the others. You read of the Lace-Wing
in the last lesson, and in the next book you will
hear about Butterflies.</p>

<p>The May-Flies are very pretty insects. They are
something like dragon-flies, but very much smaller,
and not fond of tearing up other insects. You will
find them in moist places. The body of the May-Fly
is much slimmer even than that of the dragon-fly.
The wings are unequal. Their heads are
smaller. May-Flies have two fore legs, nearly as
long as the body, held almost straight out as they
fly. On their tails they have three long stiff hairs,
twice as long as the body. These hairs spread out,
fan-shape.</p>


<p>These insects are often called May-Flies, because
they usually come in May. But they have another
name, which means the “child of an hour.” This
name is given them because they seldom live longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
than one day, and often
only for an hour
or two. In the egg,
larva, and pupa they
live about two years;
but, once born with
wings, they soon die.</p>

<p>And how do they
spend that short life?
They do not eat, for
they have no mouths.
As they are not hungry,
they do not hunt.
They spend their
whole time in flying.
Their flight is a sort
of dance in the air;
they rise and fall, and
spin about.</p>

<p>Great numbers of
them come out together,
spin about,
and drop their eggs
in the water. But
soon they flutter
down, dead, among
the grasses. That is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
the story of the pretty May-Fly. I have been on
a large island on a day when May-Flies had come
out: the air was full of their shining silver shapes—they
lit on people’s clothes, and seemed to cover
them with a gauze veil.</p>

<p>Would you not like to seek out in their homes,
and then read and study about, the very many
strange and wonderful insects that are in the world?</p>
